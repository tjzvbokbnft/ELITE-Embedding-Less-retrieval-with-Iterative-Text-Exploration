PROLOGUE 

a mountain range of rubble 

in which our narrator introduces: 

himself—the colors—and the book thief 

DEATH AND CHOCOLATE 

First the colors. 
Then the humans. 
That’s usually how I see things. 
Or at least, how I try. 

s e e HERE IS A SMALL FACT « « « 
You are going to die. 

I am in all truthfulness attempting to be cheerful about this whole 
topic, though most people find themselves hindered in believing me, 
no matter my protestations. Please, trust me. I most definitely can be 
cheerful. I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that’s only the A’s. 
Just don’t ask me to be nice. Nice has nothing to do with me. 

e © e REACTION TO THE « « « 
AFOREMENTIONED FACT 
Does this worry you? 
I urge you—don’t be afraid. 
I’m nothing if not fair. 

—Of course, an introduction. 
A beginning. 
Where are my manners? 

I could introduce myself properly, but it’s not really necessary. You 
will know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse 
range of variables. It suffices to say that at some point in time, I will 

be standing over you, as genially as possible. Your soul will be in my 
arms. A color will be perched on my shoulder. I will carry you gently 
away. 

At that moment, you will be lying there (I rarely find people 
standing up). You will be caked in your own body. There might be a 
discovery; a scream will dribble down the air. The only sound Pll hear 
after that will be my own breathing, and the sound of the smell, of 
my footsteps. 

The question is, what color will everything be at that moment when 
I come for you? What will the sky be saying? 

Personally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. 
People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see— 
the whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the 
same, and a sky to slowly suck on. It takes the edge off the stress. It 
helps me relax. 

e e e A SMALL THEORY ¢ ¢ à 
People observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and 
ends, but to me it’s quite clear that a day merges through a 
multitude of shades and intonations, with each passing moment. 
A single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. Waxy 
yellows, cloud-spat blues. Murky darknesses. 
In my line of work, I make it a point to notice them. 

As I’ve been alluding to, my one saving grace is distraction. It keeps 
me sane. It helps me cope, considering the length of time I’ve been 
performing this job. The trouble is, who could ever replace me? Who 
could step in while I take a break in your stock-standard resort-style 
vacation destination, whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety? 
The answer, of course, is nobody, which has prompted me to make a 
conscious, deliberate decision—to make distraction my vacation. 
Needless to say, I vacation in increments. In colors. 

Still, it’s possible that you might be asking, why does he even need 
a vacation? What does he need distraction from? 

Which brings me to my next point. 
It’s the leftover humans. 
The survivors. 

They’re the ones I can’t stand to look at, although on many 
occasions I still fail. I deliberately seek out the colors to keep my 
mind off them, but now and then, I witness the ones who are left 
behind, crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization, despair, 
and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs. 

Which in turn brings me to the subject I am telling you about 
tonight, or today, or whatever the hour and color. It’s the story of one 
of those perpetual survivors—an expert at being left behind. 

It’s just a small story really, about, among other things: 
* A girl 
* Some words 
* An accordionist 
* Some fanatical Germans 
* A Jewish fist fighter 
* And quite a lot of thievery 

I saw the book thief three times. 

BESIDE THE RAILWAY LINE 

First up is something white. Of the blinding kind. 

Some of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color 
and all of that tired sort of nonsense. Well, I’m here to tell you that it 
is. White is without question a color, and personally, I don’t think you 
want to argue with me. 

e ¢ ¢ A REASSURING ANNOUNCEMENT « « « 
Please, be calm, despite that previous threat. 
I am all bluster— 
I am not violent. 
I am not malicious. 
Iam a result. 

Yes, it was white. 

It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had 
pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. Next to the train line, 
footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice. 

As you might expect, someone had died. 

They couldn’t just leave him on the ground. For now, it wasn’t such a 
problem, but very soon, the track ahead would be cleared and the 
train would need to move on. 

There were two guards. 
There was one mother and her daughter. 

One corpse. 
The mother, the girl, and the corpse remained stubborn and silent. 

“Well, what else do you want me to do?” 

The guards were tall and short. The tall one always spoke first, 
though he was not in charge. He looked at the smaller, rounder one. 
The one with the juicy red face. 

“Well,” was the response, “we can’t just leave them like this, can 
we?” 

The tall one was losing patience. “Why not?” 

And the smaller one damn near exploded. He looked up at the tall 
one’s chin and cried, “Spinnst du?! Are you stupid?!” The abhorrence 
on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment. His skin widened. 
“Come on,” he said, traipsing over the snow. “We'll carry all three of 
them back on if we have to. We’ll notify the next stop.” 

As for me, I had already made the most elementary of mistakes. I 
can’t explain to you the severity of my self-disappointment. 
Originally, Pd done everything right: 
I studied the blinding, white-snow sky who stood at the window of 
the moving train. I practically inhaled it, but still, I wavered. I buckled 
—I became interested. In the girl. Curiosity got the better of me, and I 
resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed, and I 
watched. 

Twenty-three minutes later, when the train was stopped, I climbed 
out with them. 

A small soul was in my arms. 
I stood a little to the right. 

The dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother, the 
girl, and the small male corpse. I clearly remember that my breath 

was loud that day. I’m surprised the guards didn’t notice me as they 
walked by. The world was sagging now, under the weight of all that 
snow. 

Perhaps ten meters to my left, the pale, empty-stomached girl was 
standing, frost-stricken. 

Her mouth jittered. 
Her cold arms were folded. 
Tears were frozen to the book thief’s face. 

THE ECLIPSE 

Next is a signature black, to show the poles of my versatility, if you 
like. It was the darkest moment before the dawn. 
This time, I had come for a man of perhaps twenty-four years of 
age. It was a beautiful thing in some ways. The plane was still 
coughing. Smoke was leaking from both its lungs. 
When it crashed, three deep gashes were made in the earth. Its 
wings were now sawn-off arms. No more flapping. Not for this 
metallic little bird. 

e e e SOME OTHER SMALL FACTS « « « 
Sometimes I arrive too early. 
Irush, and some people cling longer to life than expected. 

After a small collection of minutes, the smoke exhausted itself. There 
was nothing left to give. 
A boy arrived first, with cluttered breath and what appeared to be a 
toolbox. With great trepidation, he approached the cockpit and 
watched the pilot, gauging if he was alive, at which point, he still 
was. The book thief arrived perhaps thirty seconds later. 
Years had passed, but I recognized her. 

She was panting. 

From the toolbox, the boy took out, of all things, a teddy bear. 

He reached in through the torn windshield and placed it on the 
pilot’s chest. The smiling bear sat huddled among the crowded 
wreckage of the man and the blood. A few minutes later, I took my 
chance. The time was right. 

I walked in, loosened his soul, and carried it gently away. 

All that was left was the body, the dwindling smell of smoke, and 
the smiling teddy bear. 

As the crowd arrived in full, things, of course, had changed. The 
horizon was beginning to charcoal. What was left of the blackness 
above was nothing now but a scribble, and disappearing fast. 
The man, in comparison, was the color of bone. Skeleton-colored 
skin. A ruffled uniform. His eyes were cold and brown—like coffee 
stains—and the last scrawl from above formed what, to me, appeared 
an odd, yet familiar, shape. A signature. 

The crowd did what crowds do. 

As I made my way through, each person stood and played with the 
quietness of it. It was a small concoction of disjointed hand 
movements, muffled sentences, and mute, self-conscious turns. 
When I glanced back at the plane, the pilot’s open mouth appeared 
to be smiling. 
A final dirty joke. 
Another human punch line. 
He remained shrouded in his uniform as the graying light arm- 
wrestled the sky. As with many of the others, when I began my 
journey away, there seemed a quick shadow again, a final moment of 
eclipse—the recognition of another soul gone. 
You see, to me, for just a moment, despite all of the colors that 
touch and grapple with what I see in this world, I will often catch an 
eclipse when a human dies. 
I’ve seen millions of them. 

I’ve seen more eclipses than I care to remember. 

THE FLAG 

The last time I saw her was red. The sky was like soup, boiling and 
stirring. In some places, it was burned. There were black crumbs, and 
pepper, streaked across the redness. 

Earlier, kids had been playing hopscotch there, on the street that 
looked like oil-stained pages. When I arrived, I could still hear the 
echoes. The feet tapping the road. The children-voices laughing, and 
the smiles like salt, but decaying fast. 

Then, bombs. 

This time, everything was too late. 
The sirens. The cuckoo shrieks in the radio. All too late. 

Within minutes, mounds of concrete and earth were stacked and 
piled. The streets were ruptured veins. Blood streamed till it was 
dried on the road, and the bodies were stuck there, like driftwood 
after the flood. 

They were glued down, every last one of them. A packet of souls. 
Was it fate? 
Misfortune? 
Is that what glued them down like that? 
Of course not. 
Let’s not be stupid. 

It probably had more to do with the hurled bombs, thrown down 
by humans hiding in the clouds. 

Yes, the sky was now a devastating, home-cooked red. The small 
German town had been flung apart one more time. Snowflakes of ash 

fell so lovelily you were tempted to stretch out your tongue to catch 
them, taste them. Only, they would have scorched your lips. They 
would have cooked your mouth. 

Clearly, I see it. 
I was just about to leave when I found her kneeling there. 

A mountain range of rubble was written, designed, erected around 
her. She was clutching at a book. 

Apart from everything else, the book thief wanted desperately to go 
back to the basement, to write, or to read through her story one last 
time. In hindsight, I see it so obviously on her face. She was dying for 
it—the safety of it, the home of it—but she could not move. Also, the 
basement didn’t even exist anymore. It was part of the mangled 
landscape. 

Please, again, I ask you to believe me. 
I wanted to stop. To crouch down. 
I wanted to say: 
“Tm sorry, child.” 
But that is not allowed. 
I did not crouch down. I did not speak. 

Instead, I watched her awhile. When she was able to move, I 
followed her. 

She dropped the book. 
She knelt. 
The book thief howled. 

Her book was stepped on several times as the cleanup began, and 
although orders were given only to clear the mess of concrete, the 
girl’s most precious item was thrown aboard a garbage truck, at 
which point I was compelled. I climbed aboard and took it in my 
hand, not realizing that I would keep it and view it several thousand 
times over the years. I would watch the places where we intersect, 
and marvel at what the girl saw and how she survived. That is the 
best I can do—watch it fall into line with everything else I spectated 
during that time. 

When I recollect her, I see a long list of colors, but it’s the three in 
which I saw her in the flesh that resonate the most. Sometimes I 
manage to float far above those three moments. I hang suspended, 
until a septic truth bleeds toward clarity. 

That’s when I see them formulate. 

s e e THE COLORS « « « 
RED: m= WHITE: © BLACK: @ 

They fall on top of each other. The scribbled signature black, onto the 
blinding global white, onto the thick soupy red. 

Yes, often, I am reminded of her, and in one of my vast array of 
pockets, I have kept her story to retell. It is one of the small legion I 
carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt— 
an immense leap of an attempt—to prove to me that you, and your 
human existence, are worth it. 
Here it is. One of a handful. 
The Book Thief. 
If you feel like it, come with me. I will tell you a story. 

Pll show you something. 

PART ONE 

the grave digger’s handbook 

featuring: 
himmel street—the art of saumensching—an ironfisted 
woman—a kiss attempt—jesse owens— 
sandpaper—the smell of friendship—a heavyweight 

champion—and the mother of all watschens 

ARRIVAL ON HIMMEL STREET 

That last time. 
That red sky ... 

How does a book thief end up kneeling and howling and flanked by 
a man-made heap of ridiculous, greasy, cooked-up rubble? 

Years earlier, the start was snow. 
The time had come. For one. 

e e eA SPECTACULARLY TRAGIC MOMENT « « « 
A train was moving quickly. 
It was packed with humans. 
A six-year-old boy died in the third carriage. 

The book thief and her brother were traveling down toward Munich, 
where they would soon be given over to foster parents. We now 
know, of course, that the boy didn’t make it. 

e © « HOW IT HAPPENED « « « 
There was an intense spurt of coughing. 
Almost an inspired spurt. 
And soon after—nothing. 

When the coughing stopped, there was nothing but the nothingness of 
life moving on with a shuffle, or a near-silent twitch. A suddenness 
found its way onto his lips then, which were a corroded brown color 
and peeling, like old paint. In desperate need of redoing. 

Their mother was asleep. 

I entered the train. 

My feet stepped through the cluttered aisle and my palm was over 
his mouth in an instant. No one noticed. The train galloped on. 
Except the girl. 

With one eye open, one still in a dream, the book thief—also known 
as Liesel Meminger—could see without question that her younger 
brother, Werner, was now sideways and dead. 

His blue eyes stared at the floor. 
Seeing nothing. 

Prior to waking up, the book thief was dreaming about the Führer, 
Adolf Hitler. In the dream, she was attending a rally at which he 
spoke, looking at the skull-colored part in his hair and the perfect 
square of his mustache. She was listening contentedly to the torrent 
of words spilling from his mouth. His sentences glowed in the light. In 
a quieter moment, he actually crouched down and smiled at her. She 
returned the smile and said, “Guten Tag, Herr Fuhrer. Wie geht’s dir 
heut?” She hadn’t learned to speak too well, or even to read, as she 
had rarely frequented school. The reason for that she would find out 
in due course. 

Just as the Fuhrer was about to reply, she woke up. 
It was January 1939. She was nine years old, soon to be ten. 
Her brother was dead. 

One eye open. 
One still in a dream. 

It would be better for a complete dream, I think, but I really have 
no control over that. 

The second eye jumped awake and she caught me out, no doubt 
about it. It was exactly when I knelt down and extracted his soul, 

holding it limply in my swollen arms. He warmed up soon after, but 
when I picked him up originally, the boy’s spirit was soft and cold, 
like ice cream. He started melting in my arms. Then warming up 
completely. Healing. 

For Liesel Meminger, there was the imprisoned stiffness of 
movement and the staggered onslaught of thoughts. Es stimmt nicht. 
This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening. 
And the shaking. 
Why do they always shake them? 

Yes, I know, I know, I assume it has something to do with instinct. 
To stem the flow of truth. Her heart at that point was slippery and 
hot, and loud, so loud so loud. 

Stupidly, I stayed. I watched. 

Next, her mother. 
She woke her up with the same distraught shake. 

If you can’t imagine it, think clumsy silence. Think bits and pieces 
of floating despair. And drowning in a train. 

Snow had been falling consistently, and the service to Munich was 
forced to stop due to faulty track work. There was a woman wailing. 
A girl stood numbly next to her. 

In panic, the mother opened the door. 
She climbed down into the snow, holding the small body. 
What could the girl do but follow? 

As you’ve been informed, two guards also exited the train. They 
discussed and argued over what to do. The situation was unsavory to 
say the least. It was eventually decided that all three of them should 

be taken to the next township and left there to sort things out. 
This time, the train limped through the snowed-in country. 
It hobbled in and stopped. 
They stepped onto the platform, the body in her mother’s arms. 
They stood. 
The boy was getting heavy. 

Liesel had no idea where she was. All was white, and as they 
remained at the station, she could only stare at the faded lettering of 
the sign in front of her. For Liesel, the town was nameless, and it was 
there that her brother, Werner, was buried two days later. Witnesses 
included a priest and two shivering grave diggers. 

e © ¢ AN OBSERVATION « « « 
A pair of train guards. 
A pair of grave diggers. 
When it came down to it, one of them called the shots. 
The other did what he was told. 
The question is, what if the other is a lot more than one? 

Mistakes, mistakes, it’s all I seem capable of at times. 

For two days, I went about my business. I traveled the globe as 
always, handing souls to the conveyor belt of eternity. I watched 
them trundle passively on. Several times, I warned myself that I 
should keep a good distance from the burial of Liesel Meminger’s 
brother. I did not heed my advice. 

From miles away, as I approached, I could already see the small 
group of humans standing frigidly among the wasteland of snow. The 
cemetery welcomed me like a friend, and soon, I was with them. I 
bowed my head. 

Standing to Liesel’s left, the grave diggers were rubbing their hands 
together and whining about the snow and the current digging 
conditions. “So hard getting through all the ice,” and so forth. One of 
them couldn’t have been more than fourteen. An apprentice. When he 
walked away, after a few dozen paces, a black book fell innocuously 
from his coat pocket without his knowledge. 

A few minutes later, Liesel’s mother started leaving with the priest. 
She was thanking him for his performance of the ceremony. 

The girl, however, stayed. 
Her knees entered the ground. Her moment had arrived. 

Still in disbelief, she started to dig. He couldn’t be dead. He 
couldn’t be dead. He couldn’t— 

Within seconds, snow was carved into her skin. 
Frozen blood was cracked across her hands. 

Somewhere in all the snow, she could see her broken heart, in two 
pieces. Each half was glowing, and beating under all that white. She 
realized her mother had come back for her only when she felt the 
boniness of a hand on her shoulder. She was being dragged away. A 
warm scream filled her throat. 

e © eA SMALL IMAGE, PERHAPS « « « 
TWENTY METERS AWAY 
When the dragging was done, the mother and the girl stood and 
breathed. 
There was something black and rectangular lodged in the snow. 
Only the girl saw it. 
She bent down and picked it up and held it firmly in her fingers. 
The book had silver writing on it. 

They held hands. 

A final, soaking farewell was let go of, and they turned and left the 
cemetery, looking back several times. 

As for me, I remained a few moments longer. 
I waved. 
No one waved back. 

Mother and daughter vacated the cemetery and made their way 
toward the next train to Munich. 

Both were skinny and pale. 
Both had sores on their lips. 

Liesel noticed it in the dirty, fogged-up window of the train when 
they boarded just before midday. In the written words of the book 
thief herself, the journey continued like everything had happened. 

When the train pulled into the Bahnhof in Munich, the passengers slid 
out as if from a torn package. There were people of every stature, but 
among them, the poor were the most easily recognized. The 
impoverished always try to keep moving, as if relocating might help. 
They ignore the reality that a new version of the same old problem 
will be waiting at the end of the trip—the relative you cringe to kiss. 

I think her mother knew this quite well. She wasn’t delivering her 
children to the higher echelons of Munich, but a foster home had 
apparently been found, and if nothing else, the new family could at 
least feed the girl and the boy a little better, and educate them 
properly. 
The boy. 

Liesel was sure her mother carried the memory of him, slung over 
her shoulder. She dropped him. She saw his feet and legs and body 
slap the platform. 

How could that woman walk? 

How could she move? 

That’s the sort of thing Pll never know, or comprehend—what 
humans are capable of. 

She picked him up and continued walking, the girl clinging now to 
her side. 

Authorities were met and questions of lateness and the boy raised 
their vulnerable heads. Liesel remained in the corner of the small, 
dusty office as her mother sat with clenched thoughts on a very hard 
chair. 

There was the chaos of goodbye. 

It was a goodbye that was wet, with the girl’s head buried into the 
woolly, worn shallows of her mother’s coat. There had been some 
more dragging. 

Quite a way beyond the outskirts of Munich, there was a town called 
Molching, said best by the likes of you and me as “Molking.” That’s 
where they were taking her, to a street by the name of Himmel. 

e ¢ eA TRANSLATION « « « 
Himmel = Heaven 

Whoever named Himmel Street certainly had a healthy sense of irony. 
Not that it was a living hell. It wasn’t. But it sure as hell wasn’t 
heaven, either. 

Regardless, Liesel’s foster parents were waiting. 
The Hubermanns. 

They’d been expecting a girl and a boy and would be paid a small 
allowance for having them. Nobody wanted to be the one to tell Rosa 
Hubermann that the boy didn’t survive the trip. In fact, no one ever 
really wanted to tell her anything. As far as dispositions go, hers 

wasn’t really enviable, although she had a good record with foster 
kids in the past. Apparently, she’d straightened a few out. 

For Liesel, it was a ride in a car. 
She’d never been in one before. 

There was the constant rise and fall of her stomach, and the futile 
hopes that they’d lose their way or change their minds. Among it all, 
her thoughts couldn’t help turning toward her mother, back at the 
Bahnhof, waiting to leave again. Shivering. Bundled up in that useless 
coat. She’d be eating her nails, waiting for the train. The platform 
would be long and uncomfortable—a slice of cold cement. Would she 
keep an eye out for the approximate burial site of her son on the 
return trip? Or would sleep be too heavy? 

The car moved on, with Liesel dreading the last, lethal turn. 

The day was gray, the color of Europe. 
Curtains of rain were drawn around the car. 

“Nearly there.” The foster care lady, Frau Heinrich, turned around 
and smiled. “Dein neues Heim. Your new home.” 

Liesel made a clear circle on the dribbled glass and looked out. 

e e eA PHOTO OF HIMMEL STREET « « « 
The buildings appear to be glued together, mostly small houses 
and apartment blocks that look nervous. 
There is murky snow spread out like carpet. 
There is concrete, empty hat-stand trees, and gray air. 

A man was also in the car. He remained with the girl while Frau 
Heinrich disappeared inside. He never spoke. Liesel assumed he was 
there to make sure she wouldn’t run away or to force her inside if she 
gave them any trouble. Later, however, when the trouble did start, he 
simply sat there and watched. Perhaps he was only the last resort, the 

final solution. 

After a few minutes, a very tall man came out. Hans Hubermann, 
Liesel’s foster father. On one side of him was the medium-height Frau 
Heinrich. On the other was the squat shape of Rosa Hubermann, who 
looked like a small wardrobe with a coat thrown over it. There was a 
distinct waddle to her walk. Almost cute, if it wasn’t for her face, 
which was like creased-up cardboard and annoyed, as if she was 
merely tolerating all of it. Her husband walked straight, with a 
cigarette smoldering between his fingers. He rolled his own. 

The fact was this: 
Liesel would not get out of the car. 

“Was ist los mit dem Kind?” Rosa Hubermann inquired. She said it 
again. “What’s wrong with this child?” She stuck her face inside the 
car and said, “Na, komm. Komm.” 

The seat in front was flung forward. A corridor of cold light invited 
her out. She would not move. 

Outside, through the circle she’d made, Liesel could see the tall 
man’s fingers, still holding the cigarette. Ash stumbled from its edge 
and lunged and lifted several times until it hit the ground. It took 
nearly fifteen minutes to coax her from the car. It was the tall man 
who did it. 

Quietly. 

There was the gate next, which she clung to. 

A gang of tears trudged from her eyes as she held on and refused to 
go inside. People started to gather on the street until Rosa 
Hubermann swore at them, after which they reversed back, whence 
they came. 

e e «A TRANSLATION OF « « « 
ROSA HUBERMANN’S ANNOUNCEMENT 
“What are you assholes looking at?” 

Eventually, Liesel Meminger walked gingerly inside. Hans Hubermann 
had her by one hand. Her small suitcase had her by the other. Buried 
beneath the folded layer of clothes in that suitcase was a small black 
book, which, for all we know, a fourteen-year-old grave digger in a 
nameless town had probably spent the last few hours looking for. “I 
promise you,” I imagine him saying to his boss, “I have no idea what 
happened to it. I’ve looked everywhere. Everywhere!” I’m sure he 
would never have suspected the girl, and yet, there it was—a black 
book with silver words written against the ceiling of her clothes: 

e e ¢ THE GRAVE DIGGER’S HANDBOOK « « « 
A Twelve-Step Guide to 
Grave-Digging Success 
Published by the Bayern Cemetery Association 

The book thief had struck for the first time—the beginning of an 
illustrious career. 

GROWING UP A SAUMENSCH 

Yes, an illustrious career. 

I should hasten to admit, however, that there was a considerable 
hiatus between the first stolen book and the second. Another 
noteworthy point is that the first was stolen from snow and the 
second from fire. Not to omit that others were also given to her. All 
told, she owned fourteen books, but she saw her story as being made 
up predominantly of ten of them. Of those ten, six were stolen, one 
showed up at the kitchen table, two were made for her by a hidden 
Jew, and one was delivered by a soft, yellow-dressed afternoon. 

When she came to write her story, she would wonder exactly when 
the books and the words started to mean not just something, but 
everything. Was it when she first set eyes on the room with shelves 
and shelves of them? Or when Max Vandenburg arrived on Himmel 
Street carrying handfuls of suffering and Hitler’s Mein Kampf? Was it 
reading in the shelters? The last parade to Dachau? Was it The Word 
Shaker? Perhaps there would never be a precise answer as to when 
and where it occurred. In any case, that’s getting ahead of myself. 
Before we make it to any of that, we first need to tour Liesel 
Meminger’s beginnings on Himmel Street and the art of saumensching: 

Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her 
hands and the frosty blood on her fingers. Everything about her was 
undernourished. Wirelike shins. Coat hanger arms. She did not 
produce it easily, but when it came, she had a starving smile. 

Her hair was a close enough brand of German blond, but she had 
dangerous eyes. Dark brown. You didn’t really want brown eyes in 
Germany around that time. Perhaps she received them from her 
father, but she had no way of knowing, as she couldn’t remember 
him. There was really only one thing she knew about her father. It 

was a label she did not understand. 

e ¢ eA STRANGE WORD « « « 
Kommunist 

She’d heard it several times in the past few years. 
“Communist.” 

There were boardinghouses crammed with people, rooms filled 
with questions. And that word. That strange word was always there 
somewhere, standing in the corner, watching from the dark. It wore 
suits, uniforms. No matter where they went, there it was, each time 
her father was mentioned. She could smell it and taste it. She just 
couldn’t spell or understand it. When she asked her mother what it 
meant, she was told that it wasn’t important, that she shouldn’t worry 
about such things. At one boardinghouse, there was a healthier 
woman who tried to teach the children to write, using charcoal on the 
wall. Liesel was tempted to ask her the meaning, but it never 
eventuated. One day, that woman was taken away for questioning. 
She didn’t come back. 

When Liesel arrived in Molching, she had at least some inkling that 
she was being saved, but that was not a comfort. If her mother loved 
her, why leave her on someone else’s doorstep? Why? Why? 
Why? 
The fact that she knew the answer—if only at the most basic level 
—seemed beside the point. Her mother was constantly sick and there 
was never any money to fix her. Liesel knew that. But that didn’t 
mean she had to accept it. No matter how many times she was told 
that she was loved, there was no recognition that the proof was in the 
abandonment. Nothing changed the fact that she was a lost, skinny 
child in another foreign place, with more foreign people. Alone. 

The Hubermanns lived in one of the small, boxlike houses on Himmel 
Street. A few rooms, a kitchen, and a shared outhouse with neighbors. 
The roof was flat and there was a shallow basement for storage. It 
was supposedly not a basement of adequate depth. In 1939, this wasn’t 
a problem. Later, in ’42 and ’43, it was. When air raids started, they 
always needed to rush down the street to a better shelter. 

In the beginning, it was the profanity that made an immediate 
impact. It was so vehement and prolific. Every second word was either 
Saumensch or Saukerl or Arschloch. For people who aren’t familiar 
with these words, I should explain. Sau, of course, refers to pigs. In 
the case of Saumensch, it serves to castigate, berate, or plain humiliate 
a female. Saukerl (pronounced “saukairl”) is for a male. Arschloch can 
be translated directly into “asshole.” That word, however, does not 
differentiate between the sexes. It simply is. 

“Saumensch, du dreckiges!” Liesel’s foster mother shouted that first 
evening when she refused to have a bath. “You filthy pig! Why won’t 
you get undressed?” She was good at being furious. In fact, you could 
say that Rosa Hubermann had a face decorated with constant fury. 
That was how the creases were made in the cardboard texture of her 
complexion. 

Liesel, naturally, was bathed in anxiety. There was no way she was 
getting into any bath, or into bed for that matter. She was twisted 
into one corner of the closetlike washroom, clutching for the 
nonexistent arms of the wall for some level of support. There was 
nothing but dry paint, difficult breath, and the deluge of abuse from 
Rosa. 

“Leave her alone.” Hans Hubermann entered the fray. His gentle 
voice made its way in, as if slipping through a crowd. “Leave her to 
me.” 

He moved closer and sat on the floor, against the wall. The tiles 
were cold and unkind. 

“You know how to roll a cigarette?” he asked her, and for the next 
hour or so, they sat in the rising pool of darkness, playing with the 
tobacco and the cigarette papers and Hans Hubermann smoking 

them. 

When the hour was up, Liesel could roll a cigarette moderately 
well. She still didn’t have a bath. 

s © ¢ SOME FACTS ABOUT = « « 
HANS HUBERMANN 
He loved to smoke. 
The main thing he enjoyed about smoking was the rolling. 
He was a painter by trade and played the piano accordion. This 
came in handy, especially in winter, when he could make a little 
money playing in the pubs of Molching, like the Knoller. 
He had already cheated me in one world war but would later be 
put into another (as a perverse kind of reward), where he would 
somehow manage to avoid me again. 

To most people, Hans Hubermann was barely visible. An un-special 
person. Certainly, his painting skills were excellent. His musical 
ability was better than average. Somehow, though, and I’m sure 
you’ve met people like this, he was able to appear as merely part of 
the background, even if he was standing at the front of a line. He was 
always just there. Not noticeable. Not important or particularly 
valuable. 

The frustration of that appearance, as you can imagine, was its 
complete misleadence, let’s say. There most definitely was value in 
him, and it did not go unnoticed by Liesel Meminger. (The human 
child—so much cannier at times than the stupefyingly ponderous 
adult.) She saw it immediately. 
His manner. 
The quiet air around him. 
When he turned the light on in the small, callous washroom that 
night, Liesel observed the strangeness of her foster father’s eyes. They 

were made of kindness, and silver. Like soft silver, melting. Liesel, 
upon seeing those eyes, understood that Hans Hubermann was worth 
a lot. 

s e e SOME FACTS ABOUT = « « 
ROSA HUBERMANN 
She was five feet, one inch tall and wore her browny gray 
strands of elastic hair in a bun. 
To supplement the Hubermann income, she did the washing and 
ironing for five of the wealthier households in Molching. 
Her cooking was atrocious. 
She possessed the unique ability to aggravate almost anyone she 
ever met. 
But she did love Liesel Meminger. 
Her way of showing it just happened to be strange. 
It involved bashing her with wooden spoon and words at 
various intervals. 

When Liesel finally had a bath, after two weeks of living on Himmel 
Street, Rosa gave her an enormous, injury-inducing hug. Nearly 
choking her, she said, “Saumensch, du dreckiges—it’s about time!” 

After a few months, they were no longer Mr. and Mrs. Hubermann. 
With a typical fistful of words, Rosa said, “Now listen, Liesel—from 
now on you call me Mama.” She thought a moment. “What did you 
call your real mother?” 

Liesel answered quietly. “Auch Mama—also Mama.” 

“Well, I’m Mama Number Two, then.” She looked over at her 
husband. “And him over there.” She seemed to collect the words in 
her hand, pat them together, and hurl them across the table. “That 

Saukerl, that filthy pig—you call him Papa, verstehst? Understand?” 
“Yes,” Liesel promptly agreed. Quick answers were appreciated in 
this household. 

“Yes, Mama,” Mama corrected her. “Saumensch. Call me Mama 
when you talk to me.” 

At that moment, Hans Hubermann had just completed rolling a 
cigarette, having licked the paper and joined it all up. He looked over 
at Liesel and winked. She would have no trouble calling him Papa. 

THE WOMAN WITH THE IRON FIST 

Those first few months were definitely the hardest. 
Every night, Liesel would nightmare. 
Her brother’s face. 
Staring at the floor. 
She would wake up swimming in her bed, screaming, and drowning 
in the flood of sheets. On the other side of the room, the bed that was 
meant for her brother floated boatlike in the darkness. Slowly, with 
the arrival of consciousness, it sank, seemingly into the floor. This 
vision didn’t help matters, and it would usually be quite a while 
before the screaming stopped. 
Possibly the only good to come out of these nightmares was that it 
brought Hans Hubermann, her new papa, into the room, to soothe 
her, to love her. 
He came in every night and sat with her. The first couple of times, 
he simply stayed—a stranger to kill the aloneness. A few nights after 
that, he whispered, “Shhh, I’m here, it’s all right.” After three weeks, 
he held her. Trust was accumulated quickly, due primarily to the 
brute strength of the man’s gentleness, his thereness. The girl knew 
from the outset that Hans Hubermann would always appear 
midscream, and he would not leave. 

e e e A DEFINITION NOT FOUND « « « 
IN THE DICTIONARY 
Not leaving: an act of trust and love, often deciphered by 
children 

Hans Hubermann sat sleepy-eyed on the bed and Liesel would cry 

into his sleeves and breathe him in. Every morning, just after two 
o'clock, she fell asleep again to the smell of him. It was a mixture of 
dead cigarettes, decades of paint, and human skin. At first, she sucked 
it all in, then breathed it, until she drifted back down. Each morning, 
he was a few feet away from her, crumpled, almost halved, in the 
chair. He never used the other bed. Liesel would climb out and 
cautiously kiss his cheek and he would wake up and smile. 

Some days Papa told her to get back into bed and wait a minute, and 
he would return with his accordion and play for her. Liesel would sit 
up and hum, her cold toes clenched with excitement. No one had ever 
given her music before. She would grin herself stupid, watching the 
lines drawing themselves down his face and the soft metal of his eyes 
—until the swearing arrived from the kitchen. 

“STOP THAT NOISE, SAUKERL!” 
Papa would play a little longer. 
He would wink at the girl, and clumsily, she’d wink back. 

A few times, purely to incense Mama a little further, he also brought 
the instrument to the kitchen and played through breakfast. 

Papa’s bread and jam would be half eaten on his plate, curled into 
the shape of bite marks, and the music would look Liesel in the face. I 
know it sounds strange, but that’s how it felt to her. Papa’s right hand 
strolled the tooth-colored keys. His left hit the buttons. (She 
especially loved to see him hit the silver, sparkled button—the C 
major.) The accordion’s scratched yet shiny black exterior came back 
and forth as his arms squeezed the dusty bellows, making it suck in 
the air and throw it back out. In the kitchen on those mornings, Papa 
made the accordion live. I guess it makes sense, when you really 
think about it. 

How do you tell if something’s alive? 
You check for breathing. 

The sound of the accordion was, in fact, also the announcement of 
safety. Daylight. During the day, it was impossible to dream of her 
brother. She would miss him and frequently cry in the tiny washroom 
as quietly as possible, but she was still glad to be awake. On her first 
night with the Hubermanns, she had hidden her last link to him—The 
Grave Digger’s Handbook—under her mattress, and occasionally she 
would pull it out and hold it. Staring at the letters on the cover and 
touching the print inside, she had no idea what any of it was saying. 
The point is, it didn’t really matter what that book was about. It was 
what it meant that was more important. 

e e e THE BOOK’S MEANING « « « 
1. The last time she saw her brother. 

2. The last time she saw her mother. 

Sometimes she would whisper the word Mama and see her mother’s 
face a hundred times in a single afternoon. But those were small 
miseries compared to the terror of her dreams. At those times, in the 
enormous mileage of sleep, she had never felt so completely alone. 

As I’m sure you’ve already noticed, there were no other children in 
the house. 

The Hubermanns had two of their own, but they were older and 
had moved out. Hans Junior worked in the center of Munich, and 
Trudy held a job as a housemaid and child minder. Soon, they would 
both be in the war. One would be making bullets. The other would be 
shooting them. 

School, as you might imagine, was a terrific failure. 

Although it was state-run, there was a heavy Catholic influence, 
and Liesel was Lutheran. Not the most auspicious start. Then they 
discovered she couldn’t read or write. 

Humiliatingly, she was cast down with the younger kids, who were 

only just learning the alphabet. Even though she was thin-boned and 
pale, she felt gigantic among the midget children, and she often 
wished she was pale enough to disappear altogether. 

Even at home, there wasn’t much room for guidance. 

“Don’t ask him for help,” Mama pointed out. “That Saukerl.” Papa 
was staring out the window, as was often his habit. “He left school in 
fourth grade.” 

Without turning around, Papa answered calmly, but with venom, 
“Well, don’t ask her, either.” He dropped some ash outside. “She left 
school in third grade.” 

There were no books in the house (apart from the one she had 
secreted under her mattress), and the best Liesel could do was speak 
the alphabet under her breath before she was told in no uncertain 
terms to keep quiet. All that mumbling. It wasn’t until later, when 
there was a bed-wetting incident midnightmare, that an extra reading 
education began. Unofficially, it was called the midnight class, even 
though it usually commenced at around two in the morning. More of 
that soon. 

In mid-February, when she turned ten, Liesel was given a used doll 
that had a missing leg and yellow hair. 

“Tt was the best we could do,” Papa apologized. 

“What are you talking about? She’s lucky to have that much,” 
Mama corrected him. 
Hans continued his examination of the remaining leg while Liesel 
tried on her new uniform. Ten years old meant Hitler Youth. Hitler 
Youth meant a small brown uniform. Being female, Liesel was 
enrolled into what was called the BDM. 

e « « EXPLANATION OF THE = « « 

ABBREVIATION 
It stood for Bund Deutscher Madel— 
Band of German Girls. 

The first thing they did there was make sure your “heil Hitler” was 
working properly. Then you were taught to march straight, roll 
bandages, and sew up clothes. You were also taken hiking and on 
other such activities. Wednesday and Saturday were the designated 
meeting days, from three in the afternoon until five. 

Each Wednesday and Saturday, Papa would walk Liesel there and 
pick her up two hours later. They never spoke about it much. They 
just held hands and listened to their feet, and Papa had a cigarette or 
two. 

The only anxiety Papa brought her was the fact that he was 
constantly leaving. Many evenings, he would walk into the living 
room (which doubled as the Hubermanns’ bedroom), pull the 
accordion from the old cupboard, and squeeze past in the kitchen to 
the front door. 

As he walked up Himmel Street, Mama would open the window 
and cry out, “Don’t be home too late!” 

“Not so loud,” he would turn and call back. 
“Saukerl! Lick my ass! I’ll speak as loud as I want!” 

The echo of her swearing followed him up the street. He never 
looked back, or at least, not until he was sure his wife was gone. On 
those evenings, at the end of the street, accordion case in hand, he 
would turn around, just before Frau Diller’s corner shop, and see the 
figure who had replaced his wife in the window. Briefly, his long, 
ghostly hand would rise before he turned again and walked slowly 
on. The next time Liesel saw him would be at two in the morning, 
when he dragged her gently from her nightmare. 

Evenings in the small kitchen were raucous, without fail. Rosa 
Hubermann was always talking, and when she was talking, it took the 
form of schimpfen. She was constantly arguing and complaining. 
There was no one to really argue with, but Mama managed it expertly 
every chance she had. She could argue with the entire world in that 
kitchen, and almost every evening, she did. Once they had eaten and 
Papa was gone, Liesel and Rosa would usually remain there, and Rosa 
would do the ironing. 

A few times a week, Liesel would come home from school and walk 
the streets of Molching with her mama, picking up and delivering 
washing and ironing from the wealthier parts of town. Knaupt Strasse, 
Heide Strasse. A few others. Mama would deliver the ironing or pick 
up the washing with a dutiful smile, but as soon as the door was shut 
and she walked away, she would curse these rich people, with all 
their money and laziness. 

“Too g’schtinkerdt to wash their own clothes,” she would say, 
despite her dependence on them. 

“Him,” she accused Herr Vogel from Heide Strasse. “Made all his 
money from his father. He throws it away on women and drink. And 
washing and ironing, of course.” 

It was like a roll call of scorn. 

Herr Vogel, Herr and Frau Pfaffelhiirver, Helena Schmidt, the 
Weingartners. They were all guilty of something. 

Apart from his drunkenness and expensive lechery, Ernst Vogel, 
according to Rosa, was constantly scratching his louse-ridden hair, 
licking his fingers, and then handing over the money. “I should wash 
it before I come home,” was her summation. 

The Pfaffelhtirvers scrutinized the results. “ ‘Not one crease in these 
shirts, please,’ ” Rosa imitated them. “ ‘Not one wrinkle in this suit.’ And 
then they stand there and inspect it all, right in front of me. Right 
under my nose! What a G’sindel—what trash.” 

The Weingartners were apparently stupid people with a constantly 
molting Saumensch of a cat. “Do you know how long it takes me to 

get rid of all that fur? It’s everywhere!” 

Helena Schmidt was a rich widow. “That old cripple—sitting there 
just wasting away. She’s never had to do a day’s work in all her life.” 

Rosa’s greatest disdain, however, was reserved for 8 Grande 
Strasse. A large house, high on a hill, in the upper part of Molching. 

“This one,” she’d pointed out to Liesel the first time they went 
there, “is the mayor’s house. That crook. His wife sits at home all day, 
too mean to light a fire—it’s always freezing in there. She’s crazy.” 
She punctuated the words. “Absolutely. Crazy.” At the gate, she 
motioned to the girl. “You go.” 

Liesel was horrified. A giant brown door with a brass knocker stood 
atop a small flight of steps. “What?” 

Mama shoved her. “Don’t you ‘what’ me, Saumensch. Move it.” 

Liesel moved it. She walked the path, climbed the steps, hesitated, 
and knocked. 

A bathrobe answered the door. 

Inside it, a woman with startled eyes, hair like fluff, and the 
posture of defeat stood in front of her. She saw Mama at the gate and 
handed the girl a bag of washing. “Thank you,” Liesel said, but there 
was no reply. Only the door. It closed. 

“You see?” said Mama when she returned to the gate. “This is what 
I have to put up with. These rich bastards, these lazy swine ...” 

Holding the washing as they walked away, Liesel looked back. The 
brass knocker eyed her from the door. 

When she finished berating the people she worked for, Rosa 
Hubermann would usually move on to her other favorite theme of 
abuse. Her husband. Looking at the bag of washing and the hunched 
houses, she would talk, and talk, and talk. “If your papa was any 
good,” she informed Liesel every time they walked through Molching, 
“T wouldn’t have to do this.” She sniffed with derision. “A painter! 
Why marry that Arschloch? That’s what they told me—my family, that 

is.” Their footsteps crunched along the path. “And here I am, walking 
the streets and slaving in my kitchen because that Saukerl never has 
any work. No real work, anyway. Just that pathetic accordion in 
those dirt holes every night.” 

“Yes, Mama.” 

“Is that all you’ve got to say?” Mama’s eyes were like pale blue 
cutouts, pasted to her face. 

They’d walk on. 
With Liesel carrying the sack. 

At home, it was washed in a boiler next to the stove, hung up by 
the fireplace in the living room, and then ironed in the kitchen. The 
kitchen was where the action was. 

“Did you hear that?” Mama asked her nearly every night. The iron 
was in her fist, heated from the stove. Light was dull all through the 
house, and Liesel, sitting at the kitchen table, would be staring at the 
gaps of fire in front of her. 

“What?” she’d reply. “What is it?” 
“That was that Holtzapfel.” Mama was already out of her seat. 
“That Saumensch just spat on our door again.” 

It was a tradition for Frau Holtzapfel, one of their neighbors, to spit 
on the Hubermanns’ door every time she walked past. The front door 
was only meters from the gate, and let’s just say that Frau Holtzapfel 
had the distance—and the accuracy. 

The spitting was due to the fact that she and Rosa Hubermann were 
engaged in some kind of decade-long verbal war. No one knew the 
origin of this hostility. They’d probably forgotten it themselves. 

Frau Holtzapfel was a wiry woman and quite obviously spiteful. 
She’d never married but had two sons, a few years older than the 
Hubermann offspring. Both were in the army and both will make 
cameo appearances by the time we’re finished here, I assure you. 

In the spiteful stakes, I should also say that Frau Holtzapfel was 

thorough with her spitting, too. She never neglected to spuck on the 
door of number thirty-three and say, “Schweine!” each time she 
walked past. One thing I’ve noticed about the Germans: 

They seem very fond of pigs. 

e © eA SMALL QUESTION AND « « « 
ITS ANSWER 
And who do you think was made to clean the spit off the door 
each night? 
Yes—you got it. 

When a woman with an iron fist tells you to get out there and clean 
spit off the door, you do it. Especially when the iron’s hot. 

It was all just part of the routine, really. 
Each night, Liesel would step outside, wipe the door, and watch the 
sky. Usually it was like spillage—cold and heavy, slippery and gray— 
but once in a while some stars had the nerve to rise and float, if only 
for a few minutes. On those nights, she would stay a little longer and 
wait. 
“Hello, stars.” 
Waiting. 
For the voice from the kitchen. 
Or till the stars were dragged down again, into the waters of the 
German sky. 

THE KISS | 
(A Childhood Decision Maker) 

As with most small towns, Molching was filled with characters. A 
handful of them lived on Himmel Street. Frau Holtzapfel was only 
one cast member. 

The others included the likes of these: 

* Rudy Steiner—the boy next door who was obsessed with the 
black American athlete Jesse Owens. 

* Frau Diller—the staunch Aryan corner-shop owner. 

* Tommy Miuller—a kid whose chronic ear infections had resulted 
in several operations, a pink river of skin painted across his face, and 
a tendency to twitch. 

* A man known primarily as “Pfiffikus’—whose vulgarity made 
Rosa Hubermann look like a wordsmith and a saint. 

On the whole, it was a street filled with relatively poor people, 
despite the apparent rise of Germany’s economy under Hitler. Poor 
sides of town still existed. 

As mentioned already, the house next door to the Hubermanns was 
rented by a family called Steiner. The Steiners had six children. One 
of them, the infamous Rudy, would soon become Liesel’s best friend, 
and later, her partner and sometime catalyst in crime. She met him on 
the street. 

A few days after Liesel’s first bath, Mama allowed her out, to play 
with the other kids. On Himmel Street, friendships were made 
outside, no matter the weather. The children rarely visited each 

other’s homes, for they were small and there was usually very little in 
them. Also, they conducted their favorite pastime, like professionals, 
on the street. Soccer. Teams were well set. Garbage cans were used to 
mark out the goals. 

Being the new kid in town, Liesel was immediately shoved between 
one pair of those cans. (Tommy Muller was finally set free, despite 
being the most useless soccer player Himmel Street had ever seen.) 

It all went nicely for a while, until the fateful moment when Rudy 
Steiner was upended in the snow by a Tommy Miller foul of 
frustration. 

“What?!” Tommy shouted. His face twitched in desperation. “What 
did I do?!” 

A penalty was awarded by everyone on Rudy’s team, and now it 
was Rudy Steiner against the new kid, Liesel Meminger. 

He placed the ball on a grubby mound of snow, confident of the 
usual outcome. After all, Rudy hadn’t missed a penalty in eighteen 
shots, even when the opposition made a point of booting Tommy 
Muller out of goal. No matter whom they replaced him with, Rudy 
would score. 

On this occasion, they tried to force Liesel out. As you might 
imagine, she protested, and Rudy agreed. 

“No, no.” He smiled. “Let her stay.” He was rubbing his hands 
together. 

Snow had stopped falling on the filthy street now, and the muddy 
footprints were gathered between them. Rudy shuffled in, fired the 
shot, and Liesel dived and somehow deflected it with her elbow. She 
stood up grinning, but the first thing she saw was a snowball 
smashing into her face. Half of it was mud. It stung like crazy. 

“How do you like that?” The boy grinned, and he ran off in pursuit 
of the ball. 

“Saukerl,” Liesel whispered. The vocabulary of her new home was 
catching on fast. 

e e e SOME FACTS ABOUT RUDY STEINER « « « 
He was eight months older than Liesel and had bony legs, sharp 
teeth, gangly blue eyes, and hair the color of a lemon. 
One of six Steiner children, he was permanently hungry. 
On Himmel Street, he was considered a little crazy. 
This was on account of an event that was rarely spoken about 
but widely regarded as “The Jesse Owens Incident,” in which he 
painted himself charcoal black and ran the 100 meters at the 
local playing field one night. 

Insane or not, Rudy was always destined to be Liesel’s best friend. A 
snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting 
friendship. 

A few days after Liesel started school, she went along with the 
Steiners. Rudy’s mother, Barbara, made him promise to walk with the 
new girl, mainly because she’d heard about the snowball. To Rudy’s 
credit, he was happy enough to comply. He was not the junior 
misogynistic type of boy at all. He liked girls a lot, and he liked Liesel 
(hence, the snowball). In fact, Rudy Steiner was one of those 
audacious little bastards who actually fancied himself with the ladies. 
Every childhood seems to have exactly such a juvenile in its midst 
and mists. He’s the boy who refuses to fear the opposite sex, purely 
because everyone else embraces that particular fear, and he’s the type 
who is unafraid to make a decision. In this case, Rudy had already 
made up his mind about Liesel Meminger. 

On the way to school, he tried to point out certain landmarks in the 
town, or at least, he managed to slip it all in, somewhere between 
telling his younger siblings to shut their faces and the older ones 
telling him to shut his. His first point of interest was a small window 
on the second floor of an apartment block. 

“That’s where Tommy Müller lives.” He realized that Liesel didn’t 
remember him. “The twitcher? When he was five years old, he got 

lost at the markets on the coldest day of the year. Three hours later, 
when they found him, he was frozen solid and had an awful earache 
from the cold. After a while, his ears were all infected inside and he 
had three or four operations and the doctors wrecked his nerves. So 
now he twitches.” 

Liesel chimed in, “And he’s bad at soccer.” 
“The worst.” 
Next was the corner shop at the end of Himmel Street. Frau Diller’s. 

e © e AN IMPORTANT NOTE « « « 
ABOUT FRAU DILLER 
She had one golden rule. 

Frau Diller was a sharp-edged woman with fat glasses and a nefarious 
glare. She developed this evil look to discourage the very idea of 
stealing from her shop, which she occupied with soldierlike posture, a 
refrigerated voice, and even breath that smelled like “heil Hitler.” The 
shop itself was white and cold, and completely bloodless. The small 
house compressed beside it shivered with a little more severity than 
the other buildings on Himmel Street. Frau Diller administered this 
feeling, dishing it out as the only free item from her premises. She 
lived for her shop and her shop lived for the Third Reich. Even when 
rationing started later in the year, she was known to sell certain hard- 
to-get items under the counter and donate the money to the Nazi 
Party. On the wall behind her usual sitting position was a framed 
photo of the Führer. If you walked into her shop and didn’t say “heil 
Hitler,” you wouldn’t be served. As they walked by, Rudy drew 
Liesel’s attention to the bulletproof eyes leering from the shop 
window. 

“Say ‘heil’ when you go in there,” he warned her stiffly. “Unless you 
want to walk a little farther.” Even when they were well past the 
shop, Liesel looked back and the magnified eyes were still there, 
fastened to the window. 

Around the corner, Munich Street (the main road in and out of 
Molching) was strewn with slosh. 

As was often the case, a few rows of troops in training came 
marching past. Their uniforms walked upright and their black boots 
further polluted the snow. Their faces were fixed ahead in 
concentration. 

Once they’d watched the soldiers disappear, the group of Steiners 
and Liesel walked past some shop windows and the imposing town 
hall, which in later years would be chopped off at the knees and 
buried. A few of the shops were abandoned and still labeled with 
yellow stars and anti-Jewish slurs. Farther down, the church aimed 
itself at the sky, its rooftop a study of collaborated tiles. The street, 
overall, was a lengthy tube of gray—a corridor of dampness, people 
stooped in the cold, and the splashed sound of watery footsteps. 

At one stage, Rudy rushed ahead, dragging Liesel with him. 
He knocked on the window of a tailor’s shop. 

Had she been able to read the sign, she would have noticed that it 
belonged to Rudy’s father. The shop was not yet open, but inside, a 
man was preparing articles of clothing behind the counter. He looked 
up and waved. 

“My papa,” Rudy informed her, and they were soon among a crowd 
of various-sized Steiners, each waving or blowing kisses at their 
father or simply standing and nodding hello (in the case of the oldest 
ones), then moving on, toward the final landmark before school. 

e e ¢ THE LAST STOP « « « 
The road of yellow stars 

It was a place nobody wanted to stay and look at, but almost 
everyone did. Shaped like a long, broken arm, the road contained 
several houses with lacerated windows and bruised walls. The Star of 
David was painted on their doors. Those houses were almost like 
lepers. At the very least, they were infected sores on the injured 

German terrain. 
“Schiller Strasse,” Rudy said. “The road of yellow stars.” 

At the bottom, some people were moving around. The drizzle made 
them look like ghosts. Not humans, but shapes, moving about beneath 
the lead-colored clouds. 

“Come on, you two,” Kurt (the oldest of the Steiner children) called 
back, and Rudy and Liesel walked quickly toward him. 

At school, Rudy made a special point of seeking Liesel out during the 
breaks. He didn’t care that others made noises about the new girl’s 
stupidity. He was there for her at the beginning, and he would be 
there later on, when Liesel’s frustration boiled over. But he wouldn’t 
do it for free. 

e e ¢ THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN « « « 
A BOY WHO HATES YOU 
A boy who loves you. 

In late April, when they’d returned from school for the day, Rudy and 
Liesel waited on Himmel Street for the usual game of soccer. They 
were slightly early, and no other kids had turned up yet. The one 
person they saw was the gutter-mouthed Pfiffikus. 

“Look there.” Rudy pointed. 

e ¢ eA PORTRAIT OF PFIFFIKUS « « « 
He was a delicate frame. 
He was white hair. 
He was a black raincoat, brown pants, decomposing shoes, and 
a mouth—and what a mouth it was. 

“Hey, Pfiffikus!” 
As the distant figure turned, Rudy started whistling. 

The old man simultaneously straightened and proceeded to swear 
with a ferocity that can only be described as a talent. No one seemed 
to know the real name that belonged to him, or at least if they did, 
they never used it. He was only called Pfiffikus because you give that 
name to someone who likes to whistle, which Pfiffikus most definitely 
did. He was constantly whistling a tune called the Radetzky March, 
and all the kids in town would call out to him and duplicate that 
tune. At that precise moment, Pfiffikus would abandon his usual 
walking style (bent forward, taking large, lanky steps, arms behind 
his raincoated back) and erect himself to deliver abuse. It was then 
that any impression of serenity was violently interrupted, for his 
voice was brimming with rage. 

On this occasion, Liesel followed Rudy’s taunt almost as a reflex 
action. 

“Pfiffikus!” she echoed, quickly adopting the appropriate cruelty 
that childhood seems to require. Her whistling was awful, but there 
was no time to perfect it. 

He chased them, calling out. It started with “Geh’ scheissen!” and 
deteriorated rapidly from there. At first, he leveled his abuse only at 
the boy, but soon enough, it was Liesel’s turn. 

“You little slut!” he roared at her. The words clobbered her in the 
back. “I’ve never seen you before!” Fancy calling a ten-year-old girl a 
slut. That was Pfiffikus. It was widely agreed that he and Frau 
Holtzapfel would have made a lovely couple. “Get back here!” were 
the last words Liesel and Rudy heard as they continued running. They 
ran until they were on Munich Street. 

“Come on,” Rudy said, once they’d recovered their breath. “Just down 
here a little.” 

He took her to Hubert Oval, the scene of the Jesse Owens incident, 
where they stood, hands in pockets. The track was stretched out in 
front of them. Only one thing could happen. Rudy started it. 
“Hundred meters,” he goaded her. “I bet you can’t beat me.” 

Liesel wasn’t taking any of that. “I bet you I can.” 
“What do you bet, you little Saumensch? Have you got any money?” 
“Of course not. Do you?” 

“No.” But Rudy had an idea. It was the lover boy coming out of 
him. “If I beat you, I get to kiss you.” He crouched down and began 
rolling up his trousers. 

Liesel was alarmed, to put it mildly. “What do you want to kiss me 
for? I’m filthy.” 

“So am I.” Rudy clearly saw no reason why a bit of filth should get 
in the way of things. It had been a while between baths for both of 
them. 

She thought about it while examining the weedy legs of her 
opposition. They were about equal with her own. There’s no way he 
can beat me, she thought. She nodded seriously. This was business. 
“You can kiss me if you win. But if J win, I get out of being goalie at 
soccer.” 

Rudy considered it. “Fair enough,” and they shook on it. 

All was dark-skied and hazy, and small chips of rain were starting 
to fall. 

The track was muddier than it looked. 
Both competitors were set. 

Rudy threw a rock in the air as the starting pistol. When it hit the 
ground, they could start running. 

“T can’t even see the finish line,” Liesel complained. 
“And I can?” 
The rock wedged itself into the earth. 
They ran next to each other, elbowing and trying to get in front. 

The slippery ground slurped at their feet and brought them down 
perhaps twenty meters from the end. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!” yelped Rudy. “I’m covered in shit!” 

“Its not shit,” Liesel corrected him, “its mud,” although she had 
her doubts. They’d slid another five meters toward the finish. “Do we 
call it a draw, then?” 

Rudy looked over, all sharp teeth and gangly blue eyes. Half his 
face was painted with mud. “If it’s a draw, do I still get my kiss?” 

“Not in a million years.” Liesel stood up and flicked some mud off 
her jacket. 

“TIl get you out of goalie.” 
“Stick your goalie.” 
As they walked back to Himmel Street, Rudy forewarned her. “One 
day, Liesel,” he said, “you’ll be dying to kiss me.” 
But Liesel knew. 
She vowed. 
As long as both she and Rudy Steiner lived, she would never kiss 
that miserable, filthy Saukerl, especially not this day. There were more 
important matters to attend to. She looked down at her suit of mud 
and stated the obvious. 
“She’s going to kill me.” 
She, of course, was Rosa Hubermann, also known as Mama, and she 

very nearly did kill her. The word Saumensch featured heavily in the 
administration of punishment. She made mincemeat out of her. 

THE JESSE OWENS INCIDENT 

As we both know, Liesel wasn’t on hand on Himmel Street when Rudy 
performed his act of childhood infamy. When she looked back, 
though, it felt like she’d actually been there. In her memory, she had 
somehow become a member of Rudy’s imaginary audience. Nobody 
else mentioned it, but Rudy certainly made up for that, so much that 
when Liesel came to recollect her story, the Jesse Owens incident was 
as much a part of it as everything she witnessed firsthand. 

It was 1936. The Olympics. Hitler’s games. 

Jesse Owens had just completed the 4 x 100m relay and won his 
fourth gold medal. Talk that he was subhuman because he was black 
and Hitler’s refusal to shake his hand were touted around the world. 
Even the most racist Germans were amazed with the efforts of Owens, 
and word of his feat slipped through the cracks. No one was more 
impressed than Rudy Steiner. 

Everyone in his family was crowded together in their family room 
when he slipped out and made his way to the kitchen. He pulled some 
charcoal from the stove and gripped it in the smallness of his hands. 
“Now.” There was a smile. He was ready. 

He smeared the charcoal on, nice and thick, till he was covered in 
black. Even his hair received a once-over. 

In the window, the boy grinned almost maniacally at his reflection, 
and in his shorts and tank top, he quietly abducted his older brother’s 
bike and pedaled it up the street, heading for Hubert Oval. In one of 
his pockets, he’d hidden a few pieces of extra charcoal, in case some 
of it wore off later. 

In Liesel’s mind, the moon was sewn into the sky that night. Clouds 

were stitched around it. 

The rusty bike crumbled to a halt at the Hubert Oval fence line and 
Rudy climbed over. He landed on the other side and trotted weedily 
up toward the beginning of the hundred. Enthusiastically, he 
conducted an awkward regimen of stretches. He dug starting holes 
into the dirt. 

Waiting for his moment, he paced around, gathering concentration 
under the darkness sky, with the moon and the clouds watching, 
tightly. 
“Owens is looking good,” he began to commentate. “This could be 
his greatest victory ever ....” 

He shook the imaginary hands of the other athletes and wished 
them luck, even though he knew. They didn’t have a chance. 

The starter signaled them forward. A crowd materialized around 
every square inch of Hubert Oval’s circumference. They were all 
calling out one thing. They were chanting Rudy Steiner’s name—and 
his name was Jesse Owens. 

All fell silent. 
His bare feet gripped the soil. He could feel it holding on between 
his toes. 

At the request of the starter, he raised to crouching position—and 
the gun clipped a hole in the night. 

For the first third of the race, it was pretty even, but it was only a 
matter of time before the charcoaled Owens drew clear and streaked 
away. 
“Owens in front,” the boy’s shrill voice cried as he ran down the 
empty track, straight toward the uproarious applause of Olympic 
glory. He could even feel the tape break in two across his chest as he 

burst through it in first place. The fastest man alive. 

It was only on his victory lap that things turned sour. Among the 
crowd, his father was standing at the finish line like the bogeyman. 
Or at least, the bogeyman in a suit. (As previously mentioned, Rudy’s 
father was a tailor. He was rarely seen on the street without a suit 
and tie. On this occasion, it was only the suit and a disheveled shirt.) 

“Was ist los?” he said to his son when he showed up in all his 
charcoal glory. “What the hell is going on here?” The crowd vanished. 
A breeze sprang up. “I was asleep in my chair when Kurt noticed you 
were gone. Everyone’s out looking for you.” 

Mr. Steiner was a remarkably polite man under normal 
circumstances. Discovering one of his children smeared charcoal 
black on a summer evening was not what he considered normal 
circumstances. “The boy is crazy,” he muttered, although he conceded 
that with six kids, something like this was bound to happen. At least 
one of them had to be a bad egg. Right now, he was looking at it, 
waiting for an explanation. “Well?” 

Rudy panted, bending down and placing his hands on his knees. “I 
was being Jesse Owens.” He answered as though it was the most 
natural thing on earth to be doing. There was even something implicit 
in his tone that suggested something along the lines of, “What the hell 
does it look like?” The tone vanished, however, when he saw the 
sleep deprivation whittled under his father’s eyes. 

“Jesse Owens?” Mr. Steiner was the type of man who was very 
wooden. His voice was angular and true. His body was tall and heavy, 
like oak. His hair was like splinters. “What about him?” 

“You know, Papa, the Black Magic one.” 

“Tll give you black magic.” He caught his son’s ear between his 
thumb and forefinger. 

Rudy winced. “Ow, that really hurts.” 
“Does it?” His father was more concerned with the clammy texture 

of charcoal contaminating his fingers. He covered everything, didn’t 
he? he thought. It’s even in his ears, for God’s sake. “Come on.” 

On the way home, Mr. Steiner decided to talk politics with the boy as 
best he could. Only in the years ahead would Rudy understand it all 
—when it was too late to bother understanding anything. 

e e e THE CONTRADICTORY POLITICS « « « 
OF ALEX STEINER 
Point One: He was a member of the Nazi Party, but he did not 
hate the Jews, or anyone else for that matter. 
Point Two: Secretly, though, he couldn’t help feeling a 
percentage of relief (or worse—gladness!) when Jewish shop 
owners were put out of business—propaganda informed him 
that it was only a matter of time before a plague of Jewish 
tailors showed up and stole his customers. 
Point Three: But did that mean they should be driven out 
completely? 
Point Four: His family. Surely, he had to do whatever he could to 
support them. If that meant being in the party, it meant being in 
the party. 
Point Five: Somewhere, far down, there was an itch in his heart, 
but he made it a point not to scratch it. He was afraid of what 
might come leaking out. 

They walked around a few corners onto Himmel Street, and Alex said, 
“Son, you can’t go around painting yourself black, you hear?” 
Rudy was interested, and confused. The moon was undone now, 
free to move and rise and fall and drip on the boy’s face, making him 

nice and murky, like his thoughts. “Why not, Papa?” 
“Because they’ll take you away.” 
“Why?” 
“Because you shouldn’t want to be like black people or Jewish 
people or anyone who is ... not us.” 
“Who are Jewish people?” 
“You know my oldest customer, Mr. Kaufmann? Where we bought 
your shoes?” 
“Yes.” 
“Well, he’s Jewish.” 
“T didn’t know that. Do you have to pay to be Jewish? Do you need 
a license?” 

“No, Rudy.” Mr. Steiner was steering the bike with one hand and 
Rudy with the other. He was having trouble steering the 
conversation. He still hadn’t relinquished the hold on his son’s 
earlobe. He’d forgotten about it. “It’s like you’re German or Catholic.” 

“Oh. Is Jesse Owens Catholic?” 

“I dopt know!” He tripped on a bike pedal then and released the 
ear. 

They walked on in silence for a while, until Rudy said, “I just wish I 
was like Jesse Owens, Papa.” 

This time, Mr. Steiner placed his hand on Rudy’s head and 
explained, “I know, son—but you’ve got beautiful blond hair and big, 
safe blue eyes. You should be happy with that; is that clear?” 
But nothing was clear. 
Rudy understood nothing, and that night was the prelude of things 
to come. Two and a half years later, the Kaufmann Shoe Shop was 

reduced to broken glass, and all the shoes were flung aboard a truck 
in their boxes. 

THE OTHER SIDE OF SANDPAPER 

People have defining moments, I suppose, especially when they’re 
children. For some it’s a Jesse Owens incident. For others it’s a 
moment of bed-wetting hysteria: 

It was late May 1939, and the night had been like most others. Mama 
shook her iron fist. Papa was out. Liesel cleaned the front door and 
watched the Himmel Street sky. 
Earlier, there had been a parade. 
The brown-shirted extremist members of the NSDAP (otherwise 
known as the Nazi Party) had marched down Munich Street, their 
banners worn proudly, their faces held high, as if on sticks. Their 
voices were full of song, culminating in a roaring rendition of 
“Deutschland uber Alles.” “Germany over Everything.” 
As always, they were clapped. 
They were spurred on as they walked to who knows where. 
People on the street stood and watched, some with straight-armed 
salutes, others with hands that burned from applause. Some kept 
faces that were contorted by pride and rally like Frau Diller, and then 
there were the scatterings of odd men out, like Alex Steiner, who 
stood like a human-shaped block of wood, clapping slow and dutiful. 
And beautiful. Submission. 
On the footpath, Liesel stood with her papa and Rudy. Hans 
Hubermann wore a face with the shades pulled down. 

e e e SOME CRUNCHED NUMBERS « « « 
In 1933, 90 percent of Germans showed unflinching support for 
Adolf Hitler. 

That leaves 10 percent who didn’t. 
Hans Hubermann belonged to the 10 percent. 
There was a reason for that. 

In the night, Liesel dreamed like she always did. At first, she saw the 
brownshirts marching, but soon enough, they led her to a train, and 
the usual discovery awaited. Her brother was staring again. 

When she woke up screaming, Liesel knew immediately that on this 
occasion, something had changed. A smell leaked out from under the 
sheets, warm and sickly. At first, she tried convincing herself that 
nothing had happened, but as Papa came closer and held her, she 
cried and admitted the fact in his ear. 

“Papa,” she whispered, “Papa,” and that was all. He could probably 
smell it. 

He lifted her gently from the bed and carried her into the 
washroom. The moment came a few minutes later. 

“We take the sheets off,” Papa said, and when he reached under and 
pulled at the fabric, something loosened and landed with a thud. A 
black book with silver writing on it came hurtling out and landed on 
the floor, between the tall man’s feet. 

He looked down at it. 
He looked at the girl, who timidly shrugged. 

Then he read the title, with concentration, aloud: “The Grave 
Digger’s Handbook.” 

So that’s what it’s called, Liesel thought. 

A patch of silence stood among them now. The man, the girl, the 
book. He picked it up and spoke soft as cotton. 

e««A2A.M. CONVERSATION « « « 

“Ts this yours?” 
“Yes, Papa.” 
“Do you want to read it?” 
Again, “Yes, Papa.” 
A tired smile. Metallic eyes, melting. 
“Well, we’d better read it, then.” 

Four years later, when she came to write in the basement, two 
thoughts struck Liesel about the trauma of wetting the bed. First, she 
felt extremely lucky that it was Papa who discovered the book. 
(Fortunately, when the sheets had been washed previously, Rosa had 
made Liesel strip the bed and make it up. “And be quick about it, 
Saumensch! Does it look like we’ve got all day?”) Second, she was 
clearly proud of Hans Hubermann’s part in her education. You 
wouldn’t think it, she wrote, but it was not so much the school who helped 
me to read. It was Papa. People think he’s not so smart, and it’s true that 
he doesn’t read too fast, but I would soon learn that words and writing 
actually saved his life once. Or at least, words and a man who taught him 
the accordion ... 

“First things first,” Hans Hubermann said that night. He washed the 
sheets and hung them up. “Now,” he said upon his return. “Let’s get 
this midnight class started.” 

The yellow light was alive with dust. 

Liesel sat on cold clean sheets, ashamed, elated. The thought of 
bed-wetting prodded her, but she was going to read. She was going to 
read the book. 

The excitement stood up in her. 
Visions of a ten-year-old reading genius were set alight. 
If only it was that easy. 

“To tell you the truth,” Papa explained upfront, “I am not such a good 
reader myself.” 

But it didn’t matter that he read slowly. If anything, it might have 
helped that his own reading pace was slower than average. Perhaps it 
would cause less frustration in coping with the girl’s lack of ability. 

Still, initially, Hans appeared a little uncomfortable holding the 
book and looking through it. 

When he came over and sat next to her on the bed, he leaned back, 
his legs angling over the side. He examined the book again and 
dropped it on the blanket. “Now why would a nice girl like you want 
to read such a thing?” 

Again, Liesel shrugged. Had the apprentice been reading the 
complete works of Goethe or any other such luminary, that was what 
would have sat in front of them. She attempted to explain. “I—when 
... It was sitting in the snow, and—” The soft-spoken words fell off 
the side of the bed, emptying to the floor like powder. 

Papa knew what to say, though. He always knew what to say. 
He ran a hand through his sleepy hair and said, “Well, promise me 
one thing, Liesel. If I die anytime soon, you make sure they bury me 
right.” 
She nodded, with great sincerity. 
“No skipping chapter six or step four in chapter nine.” He laughed, 

as did the bed wetter. “Well, ’'m glad that’s settled. We can get on 
with it now.” 
He adjusted his position and his bones creaked like itchy 
floorboards. “The fun begins.” 
Amplified by the still of night, the book opened—a gust of wind. 

Looking back, Liesel could tell exactly what her papa was thinking 
when he scanned the first page of The Grave Digger’s Handbook. As he 
realized the difficulty of the text, he was clearly aware that such a 
book was hardly ideal. There were words in there that he’d have 

trouble with himself. Not to mention the morbidity of the subject. As 
for the girl, there was a sudden desire to read it that she didn’t even 
attempt to understand. On some level, perhaps she wanted to make 
sure her brother was buried right. Whatever the reason, her hunger to 
read that book was as intense as any ten-year-old human could 
experience. 

Chapter one was called “The First Step: Choosing the Right 
Equipment.” In a short introductory passage, it outlined the kind of 
material to be covered in the following twenty pages. Types of 
shovels, picks, gloves, and so forth were itemized, as well as the vital 
need to properly maintain them. This grave digging was serious. 
As Papa flicked through it, he could surely feel Liesel’s eyes on him. 
They reached over and gripped him, waiting for something, anything, 
to slip from his lips. 
“Here.” He shifted again and handed her the book. “Look at this 
page and tell me how many words you can read.” 
She looked at it—and lied. 
“About half.” 
“Read some for me.” But of course, she couldn’t. When he made her 
point out any words she could read and actually say them, there were 
only three—the three main German words for “the.” The whole page 
must have had two hundred words on it. 
This might be harder than I thought. 
She caught him thinking it, just for a moment. 

He lifted himself forward, rose to his feet, and walked out. 

This time, when he came back, he said, “Actually, I have a better 
idea.” In his hand, there was a thick painter’s pencil and a stack of 
sandpaper. “Let’s start from scratch.” Liesel saw no reason to argue. 
In the left corner of an upturned piece of sandpaper, he drew a 
square of perhaps an inch and shoved a capital A inside it. In the 
other corner, he placed a lowercase one. So far, so good. 

“A,” Liesel said. 
“A for what?” 
She smiled. “Apfel.” 

He wrote the word in big letters and drew a misshapen apple under 
it. He was a housepainter, not an artist. When it was complete, he 
looked over and said, “Now for B.” 
As they progressed through the alphabet, Liesel’s eyes grew larger. 
She had done this at school, in the kindergarten class, but this time 
was better. She was the only one there, and she was not gigantic. It 
was nice to watch Papa’s hand as he wrote the words and slowly 
constructed the primitive sketches. 

“Ah, come on, Liesel,” he said when she struggled later on. 
“Something that starts with S. Its easy. Pm very disappointed in you.” 

She couldn’t think. 
“Come on!” His whisper played with her. “Think of Mama.” 

That was when the word struck her face like a slap. A reflex grin. 
“SAUMENSCH!” she shouted, and Papa roared with laughter, then 
quieted. 

“Shhh, we have to be quiet.” But he roared all the same and wrote 
the word, completing it with one of his sketches. 

e « e ATYPICAL HANS HUBERMANN « « « 
ARTWORK 

“Papa!” she whispered. “I have no eyes!” 

He patted the girl’s hair. She’d fallen into his trap. “With a smile 
like that,” Hans Hubermann said, “you don’t need eyes.” He hugged 
her and then looked again at the picture, with a face of warm silver. 
“Now for T.” 

With the alphabet completed and studied a dozen times, Papa leaned 
over and said, “Enough for tonight?” 

“A few more words?” 

He was definite. “Enough. When you wake up, I'll play accordion 
for you.” 

“Thanks, Papa.” 
“Good night.” A quiet, one-syllable laugh. “Good night, Saumensch.” 
“Good night, Papa.” 

He switched off the light, came back, and sat in the chair. In the 
darkness, Liesel kept her eyes open. She was watching the words. 

THE SMELL OF FRIENDSHIP 

It continued. 

Over the next few weeks and into summer, the midnight class 
began at the end of each nightmare. There were two more bed- 
wetting occurrences, but Hans Hubermann merely repeated his 
previous cleanup heroics and got down to the task of reading, 
sketching, and reciting. In the morning’s early hours, quiet voices 
were loud. 

On a Thursday, just after 3 p.m., Mama told Liesel to get ready to 
come with her and deliver some ironing. Papa had other ideas. 

He walked into the kitchen and said, “Sorry, Mama, she’s not going 
with you today.” 

Mama didn’t even bother looking up from the washing bag. “Who 
asked you, Arschloch? Come on, Liesel.” 

“She’s reading,” he said. Papa handed Liesel a steadfast smile and a 
wink. “With me. I’m teaching her. We’re going to the Amper— 
upstream, where I used to practice the accordion.” 

Now he had her attention. 

Mama placed the washing on the table and eagerly worked herself 
up to the appropriate level of cynicism. “What did you say?” 

“T think you heard me, Rosa.” 

Mama laughed. “What the hell could you teach her?” A cardboard 
grin. Uppercut words. “Like you could read so much, you Saukerl.” 

The kitchen waited. Papa counterpunched. “We’ll take your ironing 
for you.” 

“You filthy—” She stopped. The words propped in her mouth as she 
considered it. “Be back before dark.” 

“We can’t read in the dark, Mama,” Liesel said. 

“What was that, Saumensch?” 
“Nothing, Mama.” 

Papa grinned and pointed at the girl. “Book, sandpaper, pencil,” he 
ordered her, “and accordion!” once she was already gone. Soon, they 
were on Himmel Street, carrying the words, the music, the washing. 

As they walked toward Frau Diller’s, they turned around a few times 
to see if Mama was still at the gate, checking on them. She was. At 
one point, she called out, “Liesel, hold that ironing straight! Don’t 
crease it!” 

“Yes, Mama!” 
A few steps later: “Liesel, are you dressed warm enough?!” 
“What did you say?” 

“Saumensch dreckiges, you never hear anything! Are you dressed 
warm enough? It might get cold later!” 
Around the corner, Papa bent down to do up a shoelace. “Liesel,” 
he said, “could you roll me a cigarette?” 

Nothing would give her greater pleasure. 

Once the ironing was delivered, they made their way back to the 
Amper River, which flanked the town. It worked its way past, 
pointing in the direction of Dachau, the concentration camp. 

There was a wooden-planked bridge. 

They sat maybe thirty meters down from it, in the grass, writing the 
words and reading them aloud, and when darkness was near, Hans 
pulled out the accordion. Liesel looked at him and listened, though 
she did not immediately notice the perplexed expression on her 
papa’s face that evening as he played. 

e ¢ ¢e PAPA’S FACE « « « 
It traveled and wondered, but it disclosed no answers. 

Not yet. 

There had been a change in him. A slight shift. 

She saw it but didn’t realize until later, when all the stories came 
together. She didn’t see him watching as he played, having no idea 
that Hans Hubermann’s accordion was a story. In the times ahead, 
that story would arrive at 33 Himmel Street in the early hours of 
morning, wearing ruffled shoulders and a shivering jacket. It would 
carry a suitcase, a book, and two questions. A story. Story after story. 
Story within story. 

For now, there was only the one as far as Liesel was concerned, and 
she was enjoying it. 
She settled into the long arms of grass, lying back. 
She closed her eyes and her ears held the notes. 

There were, of course, some problems as well. A few times, Papa 
nearly yelled at her. “Come on, Liesel,” he’d say. “You know this 
word; you know it!” Just when progress seemed to be flowing well, 
somehow things would become lodged. 

When the weather was good, they’d go to the Amper in the 
afternoon. In bad weather, it was the basement. This was mainly on 
account of Mama. At first, they tried in the kitchen, but there was no 
way. 
“Rosa,” Hans said to her at one point. Quietly, his words cut 
through one of her sentences. “Could you do me a favor?” 
She looked up from the stove. “What?” 

“Pm asking you, I’m begging you, could you please shut your mouth 
for just five minutes?” 

You can imagine the reaction. 
They ended up in the basement. 

There was no lighting there, so they took a kerosene lamp, and 
slowly, between school and home, from the river to the basement, 
from the good days to the bad, Liesel was learning to read and write. 

“Soon,” Papa told her, “you'll be able to read that awful graves 
book with your eyes closed.” 

“And I can get out of that midget class.” 
She spoke those words with a grim kind of ownership. 

In one of their basement sessions, Papa dispensed with the sandpaper 
(it was running out fast) and pulled out a brush. There were few 
luxuries in the Hubermann household, but there was an oversupply of 
paint, and it became more than useful for Liesel’s learning. Papa 
would say a word and the girl would have to spell it aloud and then 
paint it on the wall, as long as she got it right. After a month, the wall 
was recoated. A fresh cement page. 

Some nights, after working in the basement, Liesel would sit crouched 
in the bath and hear the same utterances from the kitchen. 

“You stink,” Mama would say to Hans. “Like cigarettes and 
kerosene.” 

Sitting in the water, she imagined the smell of it, mapped out on 
her papa’s clothes. More than anything, it was the smell of friendship, 
and she could find it on herself, too. Liesel loved that smell. She 
would sniff her arm and smile as the water cooled around her. 

THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE SCHOOL-YARD 

The summer of ’39 was in a hurry, or perhaps Liesel was. She spent 
her time playing soccer with Rudy and the other kids on Himmel 
Street (a year-round pastime), taking ironing around town with 
Mama, and learning words. It felt like it was over a few days after it 
began. 

In the latter part of the year, two things happened. 

e e ¢ SEPTEMBER-NOVEMBER 1939 « « « 
1. World War Two begins. 
2. Liesel Meminger becomes the heavyweight champion of the 

school yard. 

The beginning of September. 

It was a cool day in Molching when the war began and my 
workload increased. 

The world talked it over. 
Newspaper headlines reveled in it. 

The Führer’s voice roared from German radios. We will not give up. 
We will not rest. We will be victorious. Our time has come. 

The German invasion of Poland had begun and people were 
gathered everywhere, listening to the news of it. Munich Street, like 
every other main street in Germany, was alive with war. The smell, 
the voice. Rationing had begun a few days earlier—the writing on the 
wall—and now it was official. England and France had made their 
declaration on Germany. To steal a phrase from Hans Hubermann: 

The fun begins. 

The day of the announcement, Papa was lucky enough to have some 
work. On his way home, he picked up a discarded newspaper, and 
rather than stopping to shove it between paint cans in his cart, he 
folded it up and slipped it beneath his shirt. By the time he made it 
home and removed it, his sweat had drawn the ink onto his skin. The 
paper landed on the table, but the news was stapled to his chest. A 
tattoo. Holding the shirt open, he looked down in the unsure kitchen 
light. 

“What does it say?” Liesel asked him. She was looking back and 
forth, from the black outlines on his skin to the paper. 

“ ‘Hitler takes Poland,’ ” he answered, and Hans Hubermann 
slumped into a chair. “Deutschland tiber Alles,” he whispered, and his 
voice was not remotely patriotic. 

The face was there again—his accordion face. 

That was one war started. 
Liesel would soon be in another. 

Nearly a month after school resumed, she was moved up to her 
rightful year level. You might think this was due to her improved 
reading, but it wasn’t. Despite the advancement, she still read with 
great difficulty. Sentences were strewn everywhere. Words fooled her. 
The reason she was elevated had more to do with the fact that she 
became disruptive in the younger class. She answered questions 
directed to other children and called out. A few times, she was given 
what was known as a Watschen (pronounced “varchen”) in the 
corridor. 

e e e A DEFINITION « « « 
Watschen = a good hiding 

She was taken up, put in a chair at the side, and told to keep her 
mouth shut by the teacher, who also happened to be a nun. At the 
other end of the classroom, Rudy looked across and waved. Liesel 
waved back and tried not to smile. 

At home, she was well into reading The Grave Digger’s Handbook 
with Papa. They would circle the words she couldn’t understand and 
take them down to the basement the next day. She thought it was 
enough. It was not enough. 

Somewhere at the start of November, there were some progress 
tests at school. One of them was for reading. Every child was made to 
stand at the front of the room and read from a passage the teacher 
gave them. It was a frosty morning but bright with sun. Children 
scrunched their eyes. A halo surrounded the grim reaper nun, Sister 
Maria. (By the way—I like this human idea of the grim reaper. I like 
the scythe. It amuses me.) 

In the sun-heavy classroom, names were rattled off at random. 
“Waldenheim, Lehmann, Steiner.” 
They all stood up and did a reading, all at different levels of 
capability. Rudy was surprisingly good. 
Throughout the test, Liesel sat with a mixture of hot anticipation 
and excruciating fear. She wanted desperately to measure herself, to 

find out once and for all how her learning was advancing. Was she up 
to it? Could she even come close to Rudy and the rest of them? 

Each time Sister Maria looked at her list, a string of nerves 
tightened in Liesel’s ribs. It started in her stomach but had worked its 
way up. Soon, it would be around her neck, thick as rope. 
When Tommy Miller finished his mediocre attempt, she looked 
around the room. Everyone had read. She was the only one left. 

“Very good.” Sister Maria nodded, perusing the list. “That’s 
everyone.” 

What? 

“No!” 

A voice practically appeared on the other side of the room. 
Attached to it was a lemon-haired boy whose bony knees knocked in 
his pants under the desk. He stretched his hand up and said, “Sister 
Maria, I think you forgot Liesel.” 

Sister Maria. 
Was not impressed. 

She plonked her folder on the table in front of her and inspected Rudy 
with sighing disapproval. It was almost melancholic. Why, she 
lamented, did she have to put up with Rudy Steiner? He simply 
couldn’t keep his mouth shut. Why, God, why? 

“No,” she said, with finality. Her small belly leaned forward with 
the rest of her. “I’m afraid Liesel cannot do it, Rudy.” The teacher 
looked across, for confirmation. “She will read for me later.” 

The girl cleared her throat and spoke with quiet defiance. “I can do 
it now, Sister.” The majority of other kids watched in silence. A few 
of them performed the beautiful childhood art of snickering. 

The sister had had enough. “No, you cannot! ... What are you 
doing?” 
—For Liesel was out of her chair and walking slowly, stiffly toward 
the front of the room. She picked up the book and opened it to a 
random page. 

“All right, then,” said Sister Maria. “You want to do it? Do it.” 

“Yes, Sister.” After a quick glance at Rudy, Liesel lowered her eyes 
and examined the page. 

When she looked up again, the room was pulled apart, then 
squashed back together. All the kids were mashed, right before her 
eyes, and in a moment of brilliance, she imagined herself reading the 
entire page in faultless, fluency-filled triumph. 

e e e A KEY WORD « « « 
Imagined 

“Come on, Liesel!” 
Rudy broke the silence. 
The book thief looked down again, at the words. 
Come on. Rudy mouthed it this time. Come on, Liesel. 
Her blood loudened. The sentences blurred. 

The white page was suddenly written in another tongue, and it 
didn’t help that tears were now forming in her eyes. She couldn’t 
even see the words anymore. 

And the sun. That awful sun. It burst through the window—the 
glass was everywhere—and shone directly onto the useless girl. It 
shouted in her face. “You can steal a book, but you can’t read one!” 

It came to her. A solution. 

Breathing, breathing, she started to read, but not from the book in 
front of her. It was something from The Grave Digger’s Handbook. 
Chapter three: “In the Event of Snow.” She’d memorized it from her 
papa’s voice. 
“In the event of snow,” she spoke, “you must make sure you use a 
good shovel. You must dig deep; you cannot be lazy. You cannot cut 
corners.” Again, she sucked in a large clump of air. “Of course, it is 
easier to wait for the warmest part of the day, when—” 

It ended. 

The book was snatched from her grasp and she was told. “Liesel— 
the corridor.” 

As she was given a small Watschen, she could hear them all 
laughing in the classroom, between Sister Maria’s striking hand. She 
saw them. All those mashed children. Grinning and laughing. Bathed 
in sunshine. Everyone laughing but Rudy. 

In the break, she was taunted. A boy named Ludwig Schmeikl came 
up to her with a book. “Hey, Liesel,” he said to her, “I’m having 
trouble with this word. Could you read it for me?” He laughed—a 
ten-year-old, smugness laughter. “You Dummkopf—you idiot.” 

Clouds were filing in now, big and clumsy, and more kids were 
calling out to her, watching her seethe. 

“Don’t listen to them,” Rudy advised. 
“Easy for you to say. You’re not the stupid one.” 

Nearing the end of the break, the tally of comments stood at 
nineteen. By the twentieth, she snapped. It was Schmeikl, back for 
more. “Come on, Liesel.” He stuck the book under her nose. “Help me 
out, will you?” 
Liesel helped him out, all right. 

She stood up and took the book from him, and as he smiled over his 
shoulder at some other kids, she threw it away and kicked him as 
hard as she could in the vicinity of the groin. 

Well, as you might imagine, Ludwig Schmeikl certainly buckled, 
and on the way down, he was punched in the ear. When he landed, 
he was set upon. When he was set upon, he was slapped and clawed 
and obliterated by a girl who was utterly consumed with rage. His 
skin was so warm and soft. Her knuckles and fingernails were so 
frighteningly tough, despite their smallness. “You Saukerl.” Her voice, 
too, was able to scratch him. “You Arschloch. Can you spell Arschloch 
for me?” 

Oh, how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky. 
Great obese clouds. 
Dark and plump. 
Bumping into each other. Apologizing. Moving on and finding 
room. 
Children were there, quick as, well, quick as kids gravitating 
toward a fight. A stew of arms and legs, of shouts and cheers grew 

thicker around them. They were watching Liesel Meminger give 
Ludwig Schmeikl the hiding of a lifetime. “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” 
a girl commentated with a shriek, “she’s going to kill him!” 

Liesel did not kill him. 
But she came close. 

In fact, probably the only thing that stopped her was the 
twitchingly pathetic, grinning face of Tommy Muller. Still crowded 
with adrenaline, Liesel caught sight of him smiling with such 
absurdity that she dragged him down and started beating him up as 
well. 

“What are you doing?!” he wailed, and only then, after the third or 
fourth slap and a trickle of bright blood from his nose, did she stop. 

On her knees, she sucked in the air and listened to the groans 
beneath her. She watched the whirlpool of faces, left and right, and 
she announced, “I’m not stupid.” 

No one argued. 

It was only when everyone moved back inside and Sister Maria saw 
the state of Ludwig Schmeikl that the fight resumed. First, it was 
Rudy and a few others who bore the brunt of suspicion. They were 
always at each other. “Hands,” each boy was ordered, but every pair 
was clean. 

“I don’t believe this,” the sister muttered. “It can’t be,” because sure 
enough, when Liesel stepped forward to show her hands, Ludwig 
Schmeikl was all over them, rusting by the moment. “The corridor,” 
she stated for the second time that day. For the second time that 
hour, actually. 

This time, it was not a small Watschen. It was not an average one. 
This time, it was the mother of all corridor Watschens, one sting of the 
stick after another, so that Liesel would barely be able to sit down for 
a week. And there was no laughter from the room. More the silent 
fear of listening in. 

At the end of the school day, Liesel walked home with Rudy and the 
other Steiner children. Nearing Himmel Street, in a hurry of thoughts, 
a culmination of misery swept over her—the failed recital of The 
Grave Digger’s Handbook, the demolition of her family, her 
nightmares, the humiliation of the day—and she crouched in the 
gutter and wept. It all led here. 

Rudy stood there, next to her. 
It began to rain, nice and hard. 
Kurt Steiner called out, but neither of them moved. One sat 

painfully now, among the falling chunks of rain, and the other stood 
next to her, waiting. 
“Why did he have to die?” she asked, but still, Rudy did nothing; he 
said nothing. 
When finally she finished and stood herself up, he put his arm 
around her, best-buddy style, and they walked on. There was no 
request for a kiss. Nothing like that. You can love Rudy for that, if 
you like. 
Just don’t kick me in the eggs. 
That’s what he was thinking, but he didn’t tell Liesel that. It was 
nearly four years later that he offered that information. 
For now, Rudy and Liesel made their way onto Himmel Street in 
the rain. 
He was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated 
the world. 
She was the book thief without the words. 
Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they 
arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she 
would wring them out like the rain. 

PART TWO 

the shoulder shrug 

featuring: 
a girl made of darkness—the joy of cigarettes 
—a town walker—some dead letters—hitler’s birthday— 
100 percent pure german sweat—the gates of thievery— 

and a book of fire 

A GIRL MADE OF DARKNESS 

e e ¢ SOME STATISTICAL INFORMATION « « « 
First stolen book: January 13, 1939 
Second stolen book: April 20, 1940 
Duration between said stolen books: 463 days 

If you were being flippant about it, you’d say that all it took was a 
little bit of fire, really, and some human shouting to go with it. You’d 
say that was all Liesel Meminger needed to apprehend her second 
stolen book, even if it smoked in her hands. Even if it lit her ribs. 

The problem, however, is this: 
This is no time to be flippant. 

It’s no time to be half watching, turning around, or checking the 
stove—because when the book thief stole her second book, not only 
were there many factors involved in her hunger to do so, but the act 
of stealing it triggered the crux of what was to come. It would provide 
her with a venue for continued book thievery. It would inspire Hans 
Hubermann to come up with a plan to help the Jewish fist fighter. 
And it would show me, once again, that one opportunity leads 
directly to another, just as risk leads to more risk, life to more life, 
and death to more death. 

In a way, it was destiny. 
You see, people may tell you that Nazi Germany was built on anti- 
Semitism, a somewhat overzealous leader, and a nation of hate-fed 
bigots, but it would all have come to nothing had the Germans not 

loved one particular activity: 
To burn. 

The Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, 
houses, personal items, slain people, and of course, books. They 
enjoyed a good book-burning, all right—which gave people who were 
partial to books the opportunity to get their hands on certain 
publications that they otherwise wouldn’t have. One person who was 
that way inclined, as we know, was a thin-boned girl named Liesel 
Meminger. She may have waited 463 days, but it was worth it. At the 
end of an afternoon that had contained much excitement, much 
beautiful evil, one blood-soaked ankle, and a slap from a trusted 
hand, Liesel Meminger attained her second success story. The Shoulder 
Shrug. It was a blue book with red writing engraved on the cover, and 
there was a small picture of a cuckoo bird under the title, also red. 
When she looked back, Liesel was not ashamed to have stolen it. On 
the contrary, it was pride that more resembled that small pool of felt 
something in her stomach. And it was anger and dark hatred that had 
fueled her desire to steal it. In fact, on April 20—the Fiihrer’s birthday 
—when she snatched that book from beneath a steaming heap of 
ashes, Liesel was a girl made of darkness. 

The question, of course, should be why? 
What was there to be angry about? 

What had happened in the past four or five months to culminate in 
such a feeling? 

In short, the answer traveled from Himmel Street, to the Fiihrer, to 
the unfindable location of her real mother, and back again. 

Like most misery, it started with apparent happiness. 

THE JOY OF CIGARETTES 

Toward the end of 1939, Liesel had settled into life in Molching 
pretty well. She still had nightmares about her brother and missed her 
mother, but there were comforts now, too. 
She loved her papa, Hans Hubermann, and even her foster mother, 
despite the abusages and verbal assaults. She loved and hated her best 
friend, Rudy Steiner, which was perfectly normal. And she loved the 
fact that despite her failure in the classroom, her reading and writing 
were definitely improving and would soon be on the verge of 
something respectable. All of this resulted in at least some form of 
contentment and would soon be built upon to approach the concept 
of Being Happy. 

e e ¢ THE KEYS TO HAPPINESS « « « 
1. Finishing The Grave Digger’s Handbook. 
2. Escaping the ire of Sister Maria. 

3. Receiving two books for Christmas. 

December 17. 

She remembered the date well, as it was exactly a week before 
Christmas. 

As usual, her nightly nightmare interrupted her sleep and she was 
woken by Hans Hubermann. His hand held the sweaty fabric of her 
pajamas. “The train?” he whispered. 

Liesel confirmed. “The train.” 

She gulped the air until she was ready, and they began reading 
from the eleventh chapter of The Grave Digger’s Handbook. Just past 
three o’clock, they finished it, and only the final chapter, “Respecting 
the Graveyard,” remained. Papa, his silver eyes swollen in their 
tiredness and his face awash with whiskers, shut the book and 
expected the leftovers of his sleep. He didn’t get them. 

The light was out for barely a minute when Liesel spoke to him 
across the dark. 

“Papa?” 
He made only a noise, somewhere in his throat. 
“Are you awake, Papa?” 
“Ja.” 
Up on one elbow. “Can we finish the book, please?” 

There was a long breath, the scratchery of hand on whiskers, and 
then the light. He opened the book and began. “ ‘Chapter Twelve: 
Respecting the Graveyard.’ ” 

They read through the early hours of morning, circling and writing 
the words she did not comprehend and turning the pages toward 
daylight. A few times, Papa nearly slept, succumbing to the itchy 
fatigue in his eyes and the wilting of his head. Liesel caught him out 
on each occasion, but she had neither the selflessness to allow him to 
sleep nor the hide to be offended. She was a girl with a mountain to 
climb. 

Eventually, as the darkness outside began to break up a little, they 
finished. The last passage looked like this: 

We at the Bayern Cemetery Association hope that we have informed 
and entertained you in the workings, safety measures, and duties of 
grave digging. We wish you every success with your career in the 
funerary arts and hope this book has helped in some way. 

When the book closed, they shared a sideways glance. Papa spoke. 
“We made it, huh?” 

Liesel, half-wrapped in blanket, studied the black book in her hand 
and its silver lettering. She nodded, dry-mouthed and early-morning 
hungry. It was one of those moments of perfect tiredness, of having 
conquered not only the work at hand, but the night who had blocked 
the way. 

Papa stretched with his fists closed and his eyes grinding shut, and 
it was a morning that didn’t dare to be rainy. They each stood and 
walked to the kitchen, and through the fog and frost of the window, 
they were able to see the pink bars of light on the snowy banks of 
Himmel Street’s rooftops. 

“Look at the colors,” Papa said. It’s hard not to like a man who not 
only notices the colors, but speaks them. 

Liesel still held the book. She gripped it tighter as the snow turned 
orange. On one of the rooftops, she could see a small boy, sitting, 
looking at the sky. “His name was Werner,” she mentioned. The 
words trotted out, involuntarily. 

Papa said, “Yes.” 

At school during that time, there had been no more reading tests, but 
as Liesel slowly gathered confidence, she did pick up a stray textbook 
before class one morning to see if she could read it without trouble. 
She could read every word, but she remained stranded at a much 
slower pace than that of her classmates. It’s much easier, she realized, 
to be on the verge of something than to actually be it. This would still 
take time. 

One afternoon, she was tempted to steal a book from the class 
bookshelf, but frankly, the prospect of another corridor Watschen at 
the hands of Sister Maria was a powerful enough deterrent. On top of 
that, there was actually no real desire in her to take the books from 
school. It was most likely the intensity of her November failure that 
caused this lack of interest, but Liesel wasn’t sure. She only knew that 

it was there. 
In class, she did not speak. 
She didn’t so much as look the wrong way. 

As winter set in, she was no longer a victim of Sister Maria’s 
frustrations, preferring to watch as others were marched out to the 
corridor and given their just rewards. The sound of another student 
struggling in the hallway was not particularly enjoyable, but the fact 
that it was someone else was, if not a true comfort, a relief. 

When school broke up briefly for Weihnachten, Liesel even afforded 
Sister Maria a “merry Christmas” before going on her way. Knowing 
that the Hubermanns were essentially broke, still paying off debts and 
paying rent quicker than the money could come in, she was not 
expecting a gift of any sort. Perhaps only some better food. To her 
surprise, on Christmas Eve, after sitting in church at midnight with 
Mama, Papa, Hans Junior, and Trudy, she came home to find 
something wrapped in newspaper under the Christmas tree. 

“From Saint Niklaus,” Papa said, but the girl was not fooled. She 
hugged both her foster parents, with snow still laid across her 
shoulders. 

Unfurling the paper, she unwrapped two small books. The first one, 
Faust the Dog, was written by a man named Mattheus Ottleberg. All 
told, she would read that book thirteen times. On Christmas Eve, she 
read the first twenty pages at the kitchen table while Papa and Hans 
Junior argued about a thing she did not understand. Something called 
politics. 

Later, they read some more in bed, adhering to the tradition of 
circling the words she didn’t know and writing them down. Faust the 
Dog also had pictures—lovely curves and ears and caricatures of a 
German Shepherd with an obscene drooling problem and the ability 
to talk. 

The second book was called The Lighthouse and was written by a 
woman, Ingrid Rippinstein. That particular book was a little longer, 

so Liesel was able to get through it only nine times, her pace 
increasing ever so slightly by the end of such prolific readings. 

It was a few days after Christmas that she asked a question 
regarding the books. They were eating in the kitchen. Looking at the 
spoonfuls of pea soup entering Mama’s mouth, she decided to shift 
her focus to Papa. “There’s something I need to ask.” 

At first, there was nothing. 
“And?” 
It was Mama, her mouth still half full. 
“T just wanted to know how you found the money to buy my 
books.” 
A short grin was smiled into Papa’s spoon. “You really want to 
know?” 
“Of course.” 
From his pocket, Papa took what was left of his tobacco ration and 
began rolling a cigarette, at which Liesel became impatient. 
“Are you going to tell me or not?” 
Papa laughed. “But I am telling you, child.” He completed the 

production of one cigarette, flipped it on the table, and began on 
another. “Just like this.” 

That was when Mama finished her soup with a clank, suppressed a 
cardboard burp, and answered for him. “That Saukerl,” she said. “You 
know what he did? He rolled up all of his filthy cigarettes, went to 
the market when it was in town, and traded them with some gypsy.” 

“Eight cigarettes per book.” Papa shoved one to his mouth, in 
triumph. He lit up and took in the smoke. “Praise the Lord for 
cigarettes, huh, Mama?” 
Mama only handed him one of her trademark looks of disgust, 
followed by the most common ration of her vocabulary. “Saukerl.” 

Liesel swapped a customary wink with her papa and finished eating 
her soup. As always, one of her books was next to her. She could not 
deny that the answer to her question had been more than satisfactory. 

There were not many people who could say that their education had 
been paid for with cigarettes. 

Mama, on the other hand, said that if Hans Hubermann was any 
good at all, he would trade some tobacco for the new dress she was in 
desperate need of or some better shoes. “But no ...” She emptied the 
words out into the sink. “When it comes to me, you’d rather smoke a 
whole ration, wouldn’t you? Plus some of next door’s.” 

A few nights later, however, Hans Hubermann came home with a 
box of eggs. “Sorry, Mama.” He placed them on the table. “They were 
all out of shoes.” 
Mama didn’t complain. 

She even sang to herself while she cooked those eggs to the brink of 
burndom. It appeared that there was great joy in cigarettes, and it 
was a happy time in the Hubermann household. 

It ended a few weeks later. 

THE TOWN WALKER 

The rot started with the washing and it rapidly increased. 

When Liesel accompanied Rosa Hubermann on her deliveries across 
Molching, one of her customers, Ernst Vogel, informed them that he 
could no longer afford to have his washing and ironing done. “The 
times,” he excused himself, “what can I say? They’re getting harder. 
The war’s making things tight.” He looked at the girl. “I’m sure you 
get an allowance for keeping the little one, don’t you?” 

To Liesel’s dismay, Mama was speechless. 
An empty bag was at her side. 
Come on, Liesel. 
It was not said. It was pulled along, rough-handed. 
Vogel called out from his front step. He was perhaps five foot nine 
and his greasy scraps of hair swung lifelessly across his forehead. “I’m 
sorry, Frau Hubermann!” 
Liesel waved at him. 
He waved back. 
Mama castigated. 
“Don’t wave to that Arschloch,” she said. “Now hurry up.” 

That night, when Liesel had a bath, Mama scrubbed her especially 
hard, muttering the whole time about that Vogel Saukerl and 
imitating him at two-minute intervals. “ ‘You must get an allowance 
for the girl ....2 ” She berated Liesel’s naked chest as she scrubbed 
away. “Youre not worth that much, Saumensch. You’re not making me 
rich, you know.” 

Liesel sat there and took it. 

Not more than a week after that particular incident, Rosa hauled her 
into the kitchen. “Right, Liesel.” She sat her down at the table. “Since 
you spend half your time on the street playing soccer, you can make 
yourself useful out there. For a change.” 
Liesel watched only her own hands. “What is it, Mama?” 
“From now on you're going to pick up and deliver the washing for 
me. Those rich people are less likely to fire us if you’re the one 
standing in front of them. If they ask you where I am, tell them I’m 
sick. And look sad when you tell them. You’re skinny and pale 
enough to get their pity.” 
“Herr Vogel didn’t pity me.” 

“Well ...” Her agitation was obvious. “The others might. So don’t 
argue.” 
“Yes, Mama.” 

For a moment, it appeared that her foster mother would comfort 
her or pat her on the shoulder. 

Good girl, Liesel. Good girl. Pat, pat, pat. 
She did no such thing. 

Instead, Rosa Hubermann stood up, selected a wooden spoon, and 
held it under Liesel’s nose. It was a necessity as far as she was 
concerned. “When you’re out on that street, you take the bag to each 
place and you bring it straight home, with the money, even though it’s 
next to nothing. No going to Papa if he’s actually working for once. 
No mucking around with that little Saukerl, Rudy Steiner. Straight. 
Home.” 

“Yes, Mama.” 
“And when you hold that bag, you hold it properly. You don’t swing 
it, drop it, crease it, or throw it over your shoulder.” 
“Yes, Mama.” 

“Yes, Mama.” Rosa Hubermann was a great imitator, and a fervent 
one. “You'd better not, Saumensch. Ill find out if you do; you know 
that, don’t you?” 

“Yes, Mama.” 

Saying those two words was often the best way to survive, as was 
doing what she was told, and from there, Liesel walked the streets of 
Molching, from the poor end to the rich, picking up and delivering 
the washing. At first, it was a solitary job, which she never 
complained about. After all, the very first time she took the sack 
through town, she turned the corner onto Munich Street, looked both 
ways, and gave it one enormous swing—a whole revolution—and 
then checked the contents inside. Thankfully, there were no creases. 
No wrinkles. Just a smile, and a promise never to swing it again. 

Overall, Liesel enjoyed it. There was no share of the pay, but she 
was out of the house, and walking the streets without Mama was 
heaven in itself. No finger-pointing or cursing. No people staring at 
them as she was sworn at for holding the bag wrong. Nothing but 
serenity. 

She came to like the people, too: 

* The Pfaffelhiirvers, inspecting the clothes and saying, “Ja, ja, sehr 
gut, sehr gut.” Liesel imagined that they did everything twice. 

* Gentle Helena Schmidt, handing the money over with an arthritic 
curl of the hand. 

* The Weingartners, whose bent-whiskered cat always answered the 
door with them. Little Goebbels, that’s what they called him, after 
Hitler’s right-hand man. 

* And Frau Hermann, the mayor’s wife, standing fluffy-haired and 
shivery in her enormous, cold-aired doorway. Always silent. Always 
alone. No words, not once. 

Sometimes Rudy came along. 

“How much money do you have there?” he asked one afternoon. It 
was nearly dark and they were walking onto Himmel Street, past the 
shop. “You’ve heard about Frau Diller, haven’t you? They say she’s 
got candy hidden somewhere, and for the right price ...” 

“Don’t even think about it.” Liesel, as always, was gripping the 
money hard. “It’s not so bad for you—you don’t have to face my 
mama.” 

Rudy shrugged. “It was worth a try.” 

In the middle of January, schoolwork turned its attention to letter 
writing. After learning the basics, each student was to write two 
letters, one to a friend and one to somebody in another class. 

Liesel’s letter from Rudy went like this: 

Dear Saumensch, 
Are you still as useless at soccer as you were the last time we 
played? I hope so. That means I can run past you again just like 
Jesse Owens at the Olympics .... 

When Sister Maria found it, she asked him a question, very amiably. 

e e e SISTER MARIA’S OFFER « « « 
“Do you feel like visiting the corridor, Mr. Steiner?” 

Needless to say, Rudy answered in the negative, and the paper was 
torn up and he started again. The second attempt was written to 
someone named Liesel and inquired as to what her hobbies might be. 

At home, while completing a letter for homework, Liesel decided 
that writing to Rudy or some other Saukerl was actually ridiculous. It 
meant nothing. As she wrote in the basement, she spoke over to Papa, 
who was repainting the wall again. 

Both he and the paint fumes turned around. “Was wuistz?” Now this 
was the roughest form of German a person could speak, but it was 
spoken with an air of absolute pleasantness. “Yeah, what?” 

“Would I be able to write a letter to Mama?” 

A pause. 

“What do you want to write a letter to her for? You have to put up 
with her every day.” Papa was schmunzeling—a sly smile. “Isn’t that 
bad enough?” 

“Not that mama.” She swallowed. 

“Oh.” Papa returned to the wall and continued painting. “Well, I 
guess so. You could send it to what’s-her-name—the one who brought 
you here and visited those few times—from the foster people.” 

“Frau Heinrich.” 

“That’s right. Send it to her. Maybe she can send it on to your 
mother.” Even at the time, he sounded unconvincing, as if he wasn’t 
telling Liesel something. Word of her mother had also been tight- 
lipped on Frau Heinrich’s brief visits. 

Instead of asking him what was wrong, Liesel began writing 
immediately, choosing to ignore the sense of foreboding that was 
quick to accumulate inside her. It took three hours and six drafts to 
perfect the letter, telling her mother all about Molching, her papa and 
his accordion, the strange but true ways of Rudy Steiner, and the 
exploits of Rosa Hubermann. She also explained how proud she was 
that she could now read and write a little. The next day, she posted it 
at Frau Diller’s with a stamp from the kitchen drawer. And she began 
to wait. 

The night she wrote the letter, she overheard a conversation between 
Hans and Rosa. 

“What’s she doing writing to her mother?” Mama was saying. Her 
voice was surprisingly calm and caring. As you can imagine, this 
worried the girl a great deal. She’d have preferred to hear them 
arguing. Whispering adults hardly inspired confidence. 

“She asked me,” Papa answered, “and I couldn’t say no. How could 
I?” 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” Again with the whisper. “She should 

just forget her. Who knows where she is? Who knows what they’ve 
done to her?” 

In bed, Liesel hugged herself tight. She balled herself up. She 
thought of her mother and repeated Rosa Hubermann’s questions. 

Where was she? 
What had they done to her? 
And once and for all, who, in actual fact, were they? 

DEAD LETTERS 

Flash forward to the basement, September 1943. 

A fourteen-year-old girl is writing in a small dark-covered book. 
She is bony but strong and has seen many things. Papa sits with the 
accordion at his feet. 

He says, “You know, Liesel? I nearly wrote you a reply and signed 
your mother’s name.” He scratches his leg, where the plaster used to 
be. “But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself.” 

Several times, through the remainder of January and the entirety of 
February 1940, when Liesel searched the mailbox for a reply to her 
letter, it clearly broke her foster father’s heart. “I’m sorry,” he would 
tell her. “Not today, huh?” In hindsight, she saw that the whole 
exercise had been pointless. Had her mother been in a position to do 
so, she would have already made contact with the foster care people, 
or directly with the girl, or the Hubermanns. But there had been 
nothing. 

To lend insult to injury, in mid-February, Liesel was given a letter 
from another ironing customer, the Pfaffelhtirvers, from Heide 
Strasse. The pair of them stood with great tallness in the doorway, 
giving her a melancholic regard. “For your mama,” the man said, 
handing her the envelope. “Tell her we’re sorry. Tell her we’re sorry.” 
That was not a good night in the Hubermann residence. 
Even when Liesel retreated to the basement to write her fifth letter 
to her mother (all but the first one yet to be sent), she could hear 

Rosa swearing and carrying on about those Pfaffelhtirver Arschlocher 
and that lousy Ernst Vogel. 

“Feuer soll’n’s brunzen fiir einen Monat!” she heard her call out. 
Translation: “They should all piss fire for a month!” 

Liesel wrote. 

When her birthday came around, there was no gift. There was no gift 
because there was no money, and at the time, Papa was out of 
tobacco. 

“T told you.” Mama pointed a finger at him. “I told you not to give 
her both books at Christmas. But no. Did you listen? Of course not!” 

“T know!” He turned quietly to the girl. “I’m sorry, Liesel. We just 
can’t afford it.” 

Liesel didn’t mind. She didn’t whine or moan or stamp her feet. She 
simply swallowed the disappointment and decided on one calculated 
risk—a present from herself. She would gather all of the accrued 
letters to her mother, stuff them into one envelope, and use just a tiny 
portion of the washing and ironing money to mail it. Then, of course, 
she would take the Watschen, most likely in the kitchen, and she 
would not make a sound. 

Three days later, the plan came to fruition. 

“Some of it’s missing.” Mama counted the money a fourth time, 
with Liesel over at the stove. It was warm there and it cooked the fast 
flow of her blood. “What happened, Liesel?” 

She lied. “They must have given me less than usual.” 
“Did you count it?” 
She broke. “I spent it, Mama.” 

Rosa came closer. This was not a good sign. She was very close to 
the wooden spoons. “You what?” 
Before she could answer, the wooden spoon came down on Liesel 
Meminger’s body like the gait of God. Red marks like footprints, and 
they burned. From the floor, when it was over, the girl actually 
looked up and explained. 

There was pulse and yellow light, all together. Her eyes blinked. “I 

mailed my letters.” 

What came to her then was the dustiness of the floor, the feeling 
that her clothes were more next to her than on her, and the sudden 
realization that this would all be for nothing—that her mother would 
never write back and she would never see her again. The reality of 
this gave her a second Watschen. It stung her, and it did not stop for 
many minutes. 

Above her, Rosa appeared to be smudged, but she soon clarified as 
her cardboard face loomed closer. Dejected, she stood there in all her 
plumpness, holding the wooden spoon at her side like a club. She 
reached down and leaked a little. “I’m sorry, Liesel.” 

Liesel knew her well enough to understand that it was not for the 
hiding. 
The red marks grew larger, in patches on her skin, as she lay there, 
in the dust and the dirt and the dim light. Her breathing calmed, and 
a stray yellow tear trickled down her face. She could feel herself 
against the floor. A forearm, a knee. An elbow. A cheek. A calf 
muscle. 

The floor was cold, especially against her cheek, but she was unable 
to move. 

She would never see her mother again. 

For nearly an hour, she remained, spread out under the kitchen 
table, till Papa came home and played the accordion. Only then did 
she sit up and start to recover. 

When she wrote about that night, she held no animosity toward 
Rosa Hubermann at all, or toward her mother for that matter. To her, 
they were only victims of circumstance. The only thought that 
continually recurred was the yellow tear. Had it been dark, she 
realized, that tear would have been black. 

But it was dark, she told herself. 

No matter how many times she tried to imagine that scene with the 
yellow light that she knew had been there, she had to struggle to 
visualize it. She was beaten in the dark, and she had remained there, 

on a cold, dark kitchen floor. Even Papa’s music was the color of 
darkness. 
Even Papa’s music. 
The strange thing was that she was vaguely comforted by that 
thought, rather than distressed by it. The dark, the light. What was 
the difference? 
Nightmares had reinforced themselves in each, as the book thief 
began to truly understand how things were and how they would 
always be. If nothing else, she could prepare herself. Perhaps that’s 
why on the Fuhrer‘s birthday, when the answer to the question of her 
mother’s suffering showed itself completely, she was able to react, 
despite her perplexity and her rage. 
Liesel Meminger was ready. 
Happy birthday, Herr Hitler. 

Many happy returns. 

HITLER’S BIRTHDAY, 1940 

Against all hopelessness, Liesel still checked the mailbox each 
afternoon, throughout March and well into April. This was despite a 
Hans-requested visit from Frau Heinrich, who explained to the 
Hubermanns that the foster care office had lost contact completely 
with Paula Meminger. Still, the girl persisted, and as you might 
expect, each day, when she searched the mail, there was nothing. 

Molching, like the rest of Germany, was in the grip of preparing for 
Hitler’s birthday. This particular year, with the development of the 
war and Hitler’s current victorious position, the Nazi partisans of 
Molching wanted the celebration to be especially befitting. There 
would be a parade. Marching. Music. Singing. There would be a fire. 

While Liesel walked the streets of Molching, picking up and 
delivering washing and ironing, Nazi Party members were 
accumulating fuel. A couple of times, Liesel was a witness to men and 
women knocking on doors, asking people if they had any material 
that they felt should be done away with or destroyed. Papa’s copy of 
the Molching Express announced that there would be a celebratory fire 
in the town square, which would be attended by all local Hitler Youth 
divisions. It would commemorate not only the Fiihrer’s birthday, but 
the victory over his enemies and over the restraints that had held 
Germany back since the end of World War I. “Any materials,” it 
requested, “from such times—newspapers, posters, books, flags—and 
any found propaganda of our enemies should be brought forward to 
the Nazi Party office on Munich Street.” Even Schiller Strasse—the 
road of yellow stars—which was still awaiting its renovation, was 
ransacked one last time, to find something, anything, to burn in the 
name of the Fihrer’s glory. It would have come as no surprise if 
certain members of the party had gone away and published a 
thousand or so books or posters of poisonous moral matter simply to 
incinerate them. 

Everything was in place to make April 20 magnificent. It would be 
a day full of burning and cheering. 

And book thievery. 

In the Hubermann household that morning, all was typical. 

“That Saukerl’s looking out the window again,” cursed Rosa 
Hubermann. “Every day,” she went on. “What are you looking at this 
time?” 
“Ohhh,” moaned Papa with delight. The flag cloaked his back from 
the top of the window. “You should have a look at this woman I can 
see.” He glanced over his shoulder and grinned at Liesel. “I might just 
go and run after her. She leaves you for dead, Mama.” 

“Schwein!” She shook the wooden spoon at him. 

Papa continued looking out the window, at an imaginary woman 
and a very real corridor of German flags. 

On the streets of Molching that day, each window was decorated for 
the Fuhrer. In some places, like Frau Diller’s, the glass was vigorously 
washed, and the swastika looked like a jewel on a red-and-white 
blanket. In others, the flag trundled from the ledge like washing hung 
out to dry. But it was there. 

Earlier, there had been a minor calamity. The Hubermanns couldn’t 
find their flag. 

“They'll come for us,” Mama warned her husband. “They’ll come 
and take us away.” They. “We have to find it!” At one point, it 
seemed like Papa might have to go down to the basement and paint a 
flag on one of his drop sheets. Thankfully, it turned up, buried behind 
the accordion in the cupboard. 

99 
! 

“That infernal accordion, it was blocking my view!” Mama 

swiveled. “Liesel!” 

The girl had the honor of pinning the flag to the window frame. 

Hans Junior and Trudy came home for the afternoon eating, like they 
did at Christmas or Easter. Now seems like a good time to introduce 
them a little more comprehensively: 

Hans Junior had the eyes of his father and the height. The silver in 
his eyes, however, wasn’t warm, like Papa’s—they’d been Ftihrered. 
There was more flesh on his bones, too, and he had prickly blond hair 
and skin like off-white paint. 

Trudy, or Trudel, as she was often known, was only a few inches 
taller than Mama. She had cloned Rosa Hubermann’s unfortunate, 
waddlesome walking style, but the rest of her was much milder. Being 
a live-in housemaid in a wealthy part of Munich, she was most likely 
bored of children, but she was always capable of at least a few smiled 
words in Liesel’s direction. She had soft lips. A quiet voice. 

They came home together on the train from Munich, and it didn’t 
take long for old tensions to rise up. 

e © eA SHORT HISTORY OF « « « 
HANS HUBERMANN VS. HIS SON 
The young man was a Nazi; his father was not. In the opinion of 
Hans Junior, his father was part of an old, decrepit Germany— 
one that allowed everyone else to take it for the proverbial ride 
while its own people suffered. As a teenager, he was aware that 
his father had been called “Der Juden Maler’—the Jew painter— 
for painting Jewish houses. Then came an incident Ill fully 
present to you soon enough—the day Hans blew it, on the verge 
of joining the party. Everyone knew you weren’t supposed to 
paint over slurs written on a Jewish shop front. Such behavior 
was bad for Germany, and it was bad for the transgressor. 

“So have they let you in yet?” Hans Junior was picking up where 
they’d left off at Christmas. 

“In what?” 
“Take a guess—the party.” 
“No, I think they’ve forgotten about me.” 

“Well, have you even tried again? You can’t just sit around waiting 
for the new world to take it with you. You have to go out and be part 
of it—despite your past mistakes.” 

Papa looked up. “Mistakes? I’ve made many mistakes in my life, 
but not joining the Nazi Party isn’t one of them. They still have my 
application—you know that—but I couldn’t go back to ask. I just ...” 

That was when a great shiver arrived. 

It waltzed through the window with the draft. Perhaps it was the 
breeze of the Third Reich, gathering even greater strength. Or maybe 
it was just Europe again, breathing. Either way, it fell across them as 
their metallic eyes clashed like tin cans in the kitchen. 

“You’ve never cared about this country,” said Hans Junior. “Not 
enough, anyway.” 
Papa’s eyes started corroding. It did not stop Hans Junior. He 
looked now for some reason at the girl. With her three books standing 
upright on the table, as if in conversation, Liesel was silently 
mouthing the words as she read from one of them. “And what trash is 
this girl reading? She should be reading Mein Kampf.” 

Liesel looked up. 

“Don’t worry, Liesel,” Papa said. “Just keep reading. He doesn’t 
know what he’s saying.” 
But Hans Junior wasn’t finished. He stepped closer and said, 
“Youre either for the Fuhrer or against him—and I can see that you’re 
against him. You always have been.” Liesel watched Hans Junior in 

the face, fixated on the thinness of his lips and the rocky line of his 
bottom teeth. “It’s pathetic—how a man can stand by and do nothing 
as a whole nation cleans out the garbage and makes itself great.” 

Trudy and Mama sat silently, scaredly, as did Liesel. There was the 
smell of pea soup, something burning, and confrontation. 
They were all waiting for the next words. 
They came from the son. Just two of them. 

“You coward.” He upturned them into Papa’s face, and he promptly 
left the kitchen, and the house. 

Ignoring futility, Papa walked to the doorway and called out to his 
son. “Coward? I’m the coward?!” He then rushed to the gate and ran 
pleadingly after him. Mama hurried to the window, ripped away the 
flag, and opened up. She, Trudy, and Liesel all crowded together, 
watching a father catch up to his son and grab hold of him, begging 
him to stop. They could hear nothing, but the manner in which Hans 
Junior shrugged loose was loud enough. The sight of Papa watching 
him walk away roared at them from up the street. 

“Hansi!” Mama finally cried out. Both Trudy and Liesel flinched 
from her voice. “Come back!” 

The boy was gone. 

Yes, the boy was gone, and I wish I could tell you that everything 
worked out for the younger Hans Hubermann, but it didn’t. 

When he vanished from Himmel Street that day in the name of the 
Fuhrer, he would hurtle through the events of another story, each step 
leading tragically to Russia. 

To Stalingrad. 

e e e SOME FACTS ABOUT STALINGRAD « « « 
1. In 1942 and early ’43, in that city, the sky was bleached 

bedsheet-white each morning. 
2. All day long, as I carried the souls across it, that sheet was 
splashed with blood, until it was full and bulging to the earth. 
3. In the evening, it would be wrung out and bleached again, 
ready for the next dawn. 
4, And that was when the fighting was only during the day. 

With his son gone, Hans Hubermann stood for a few moments longer. 
The street looked so big. 

When he reappeared inside, Mama fixed her gaze on him, but no 
words were exchanged. She didn’t admonish him at all, which, as you 
know, was highly unusual. Perhaps she decided he was injured 
enough, having been labeled a coward by his only son. 

For a while, he remained silently at the table after the eating was 
finished. Was he really a coward, as his son had so brutally pointed 
out? Certainly, in World War I, he considered himself one. He 
attributed his survival to it. But then, is there cowardice in the 
acknowledgment of fear? Is there cowardice in being glad that you 
lived? 
His thoughts crisscrossed the table as he stared into it. 

“Papa?” Liesel asked, but he did not look at her. “What was he 
talking about? What did he mean when ...” 

“Nothing,” Papa answered. He spoke quiet and calm, to the table. 
“Its nothing. Forget about him, Liesel.” It took perhaps a minute for 
him to speak again. “Shouldn’t you be getting ready?” He looked at 
her this time. “Don’t you have a bonfire to go to?” 

“Yes, Papa.” 
The book thief went and changed into her Hitler Youth uniform, 
and half an hour later, they left, walking to the BDM headquarters. 

From there, the children would be taken to the town square in their 
groups. 

Speeches would be made. 
A fire would be lit. 
A book would be stolen. 

100 PERCENT PURE GERMAN SWEAT 

People lined the streets as the youth of Germany marched toward the 
town hall and the square. On quite a few occasions Liesel forgot about 
her mother and any other problem of which she currently held 
ownership. There was a swell in her chest as the people clapped them 
on. Some kids waved to their parents, but only briefly—it was an 
explicit instruction that they march straight and don’t look or wave to 
the crowd. 

When Rudy’s group came into the square and was instructed to 
halt, there was a discrepancy. Tommy Müller. The rest of the 
regiment stopped marching and Tommy plowed directly into the boy 
in front of him. 

“Dummkopf!” the boy spat before turning around. 

“Pm sorry,” said Tommy, arms held apologetically out. His face 
tripped over itself. “I couldn’t hear.” It was only a small moment, but 
it was also a preview of troubles to come. For Tommy. For Rudy. 

At the end of the marching, the Hitler Youth divisions were allowed 
to disperse. It would have been near impossible to keep them all 
together as the bonfire burned in their eyes and excited them. 
Together, they cried one united “heil Hitler” and were free to wander. 
Liesel looked for Rudy, but once the crowd of children scattered, she 
was caught inside a mess of uniforms and high-pitched words. Kids 
calling out to other kids. 

By four-thirty, the air had cooled considerably. 

People joked that they needed warming up. “That’s all this trash is 
good for anyway.” 

Carts were used to wheel it all in. It was dumped in the middle of 

the town square and dowsed with something sweet. Books and paper 
and other material would slide or tumble down, only to be thrown 
back onto the pile. From further away, it looked like something 
volcanic. Or something grotesque and alien that had somehow landed 
miraculously in the middle of town and needed to be snuffed out, and 
fast. 

The applied smell leaned toward the crowd, who were kept at a 
good distance. There were well in excess of a thousand people, on the 
ground, on the town hall steps, on the rooftops that surrounded the 
square. 

When Liesel tried to make her way through, a crackling sound 
prompted her to think that the fire had already begun. It hadn’t. The 
sound was kinetic humans, flowing, charging up. 

They’ve started without me! 

Although something inside told her that this was a crime—after all, 
her three books were the most precious items she owned—she was 
compelled to see the thing lit. She couldn’t help it. I guess humans 
like to watch a little destruction. Sand castles, houses of cards, that’s 
where they begin. Their great skill is their capacity to escalate. 

The thought of missing it was eased when she found a gap in the 
bodies and was able to see the mound of guilt, still intact. It was 
prodded and splashed, even spat on. It reminded her of an unpopular 
child, forlorn and bewildered, powerless to alter its fate. No one liked 
it. Head down. Hands in pockets. Forever. Amen. 

Bits and pieces continued falling to its sides as Liesel hunted for 
Rudy. Where is that Saukerl? 

When she looked up, the sky was crouching. 

A horizon of Nazi flags and uniforms rose upward, crippling her 
view every time she attempted to see over a smaller child’s head. It 
was pointless. The crowd was itself. There was no swaying it, 
squeezing through, or reasoning with it. You breathed with it and you 
sang its songs. You waited for its fire. 

Silence was requested by a man on a podium. His uniform was shiny 
brown. The iron was practically still on it. The silence began. 

His first words: “Heil Hitler!” 

His first action: the salute to the Fiihrer. 

“Today is a beautiful day,” he continued. “Not only is it our great 
leader’s birthday—but we also stop our enemies once again. We stop 
them reaching into our minds ....” 

Liesel still attempted to fight her way through. 

“We put an end to the disease that has been spread through 
Germany for the last twenty years, if not more!” He was performing 
now what is called a Schreierei—a consummate exhibition of 
passionate shouting—warning the crowd to be watchful, to be 
vigilant, to seek out and destroy the evil machinations plotting to 
infect the motherland with its deplorable ways. “The immoral! The 
Kommunisten!” That word again. That old word. Dark rooms. Suit- 
wearing men. “Die Juden—the Jews!” 

Halfway through the speech, Liesel surrendered. As the word 
communist seized her, the remainder of the Nazi recital swept by, 
either side, lost somewhere in the German feet around her. Waterfalls 
of words. A girl treading water. She thought it again. Kommunisten. 

Up until now, at the BDM, they had been told that Germany was 
the superior race, but no one else in particular had been mentioned. 
Of course, everyone knew about the Jews, as they were the main 
offender in regard to violating the German ideal. Not once, however, 
had the communists been mentioned until today, regardless of the 
fact that people of such political creed were also to be punished. 

She had to get out. 

In front of her, a head with parted blond hair and pigtails sat 
absolutely still on its shoulders. Staring into it, Liesel revisited those 

dark rooms of her past and her mother answering questions made up 
of one word. 

She saw it all so clearly. 
Her starving mother, her missing father. Kommunisten. 
Her dead brother. 
“And now we say goodbye to this trash, this poison.” 

Just before Liesel Meminger pivoted with nausea to exit the crowd, 
the shiny, brown-shirted creature walked from the podium. He 
received a torch from an accomplice and lit the mound, which 
dwarfed him in all its culpability. “Heil Hitler!” 

The audience: “Heil Hitler!” 

A collection of men walked from a platform and surrounded the 
heap, igniting it, much to the approval of everyone. Voices climbed 
over shoulders and the smell of pure German sweat struggled at first, 
then poured out. It rounded corner after corner, till they were all 
swimming in it. The words, the sweat. And smiling. Let’s not forget 
the smiling. 

Many jocular comments followed, as did another onslaught of “heil 
Hitlering.” You know, it actually makes me wonder if anyone ever 
lost an eye or injured a hand or wrist with all of that. You’d only need 
to be facing the wrong way at the wrong time or stand marginally too 
close to another person. Perhaps people did get injured. Personally, I 
can only tell you that no one died from it, or at least, not physically. 
There was, of course, the matter of forty million people I picked up 
by the time the whole thing was finished, but that’s getting all 
metaphoric. Allow me to return us to the fire. 

The orange flames waved at the crowd as paper and print dissolved 
inside them. Burning words were torn from their sentences. 

On the other side, beyond the blurry heat, it was possible to see the 
brownshirts and swastikas joining hands. You didn’t see people. Only 
uniforms and signs. 

Birds above did laps. 

They circled, somehow attracted to the glow—until they came too 
close to the heat. Or was it the humans? Certainly, the heat was 
nothing. 

In her attempt to escape, a voice found her. 
“Liesel!” 

It made its way through and she recognized it. It was not Rudy, but 
she knew that voice. 

She twisted free and found the face attached to it. Oh, no. Ludwig 
Schmeikl. He did not, as she expected, sneer or joke or make any 
conversation at all. All he was able to do was pull her toward him and 
motion to his ankle. It had been crushed among the excitement and 
was bleeding dark and ominous through his sock. His face wore a 
helpless expression beneath his tangled blond hair. An animal. Not a 
deer in lights. Nothing so typical or specific. He was just an animal, 
hurt among the melee of its own kind, soon to be trampled by it. 

Somehow, she helped him up and dragged him toward the back. 
Fresh air. 

They staggered to the steps at the side of the church. There was 
some room there and they rested, both relieved. 

Breath collapsed from Schmeikl’s mouth. It slipped down, over his 
throat. He managed to speak. 

Sitting down, he held his ankle and found Liesel Meminger’s face. 
“Thanks,” he said, to her mouth rather than her eyes. More slabs of 
breath. “And ...” They both watched images of school-yard antics, 
followed by a school-yard beating. “I’m sorry—for, you know.” 

Liesel heard it again. 
Kommunisten. 
She chose, however, to focus on Ludwig Schmeikl. “Me too.” 
They both concentrated on breathing then, for there was nothing 

more to do or say. Their business had come to an end. 
The blood enlarged on Ludwig Schmeikl’s ankle. 
A single word leaned against the girl. 
To their left, flames and burning books were cheered like heroes. 

THE GATES OF THIEVERY 

She remained on the steps, waiting for Papa, watching the stray ash 
and the corpse of collected books. Everything was sad. Orange and 
red embers looked like rejected candy, and most of the crowd had 
vanished. She’d seen Frau Diller leave (very satisfied) and Pfiffikus 
(white hair, a Nazi uniform, the same dilapidated shoes, and a 
triumphant whistle). Now there was nothing but cleaning up, and 
soon, no one would even imagine it had happened. 

But you could smell it. 

“What are you doing?” 
Hans Hubermann arrived at the church steps. 
“Hi, Papa.” 
“You were supposed to be in front of the town hall.” 
“Sorry, Papa.” 

He sat down next to her, halving his tallness on the concrete and 
taking a piece of Liesel’s hair. His fingers adjusted it gently behind 
her ear. “Liesel, what’s wrong?” 

For a while, she said nothing. She was making calculations, despite 
already knowing. An eleven-year-old girl is many things, but she is 
not stupid. 

s e «A SMALL ADDITION « « « 
The word communist + a large bonfire + a collection of dead 
letters + the suffering of her mother + the death of her brother 
= the Fuhrer 

The Führer. 

He was the they that Hans and Rosa Hubermann were talking about 
that evening when she first wrote to her mother. She knew it, but she 
had to ask. 

“Is my mother a communist?” Staring. Straight ahead. “They were 
always asking her things, before I came here.” 

Hans edged forward a little, forming the beginnings of a lie. “I have 
no idea—I never met her.” 

“Did the Führer take her away?” 

The question surprised them both, and it forced Papa to stand up. 
He looked at the brown-shirted men taking to the pile of ash with 
shovels. He could hear them hacking into it. Another lie was growing 
in his mouth, but he found it impossible to let it out. He said, “I think 
he might have, yes.” 

“I knew it.” The words were thrown at the steps and Liesel could 
feel the slush of anger, stirring hotly in her stomach. “I hate the 
Führer,” she said. “I hate him.” 

And Hans Hubermann? 
What did he do? 
What did he say? 

Did he bend down and embrace his foster daughter, as he wanted 
to? Did he tell her that he was sorry for what was happening to her, 
to her mother, for what had happened to her brother? 

Not exactly. 
He clenched his eyes. Then opened them. He slapped Liesel 
Meminger squarely in the face. 
“Don’t ever say that!” His voice was quiet, but sharp. 
As the girl shook and sagged on the steps, he sat next to her and 
held his face in his hands. It would be easy to say that he was just a 
tall man sitting poor-postured and shattered on some church steps, 

but he wasn’t. At the time, Liesel had no idea that her foster father, 
Hans Hubermann, was contemplating one of the most dangerous 

dilemmas a German citizen could face. Not only that, he’d been facing 
it for close to a year. 
“Papa?” 
The surprise in her voice rushed her, but it also rendered her 
useless. She wanted to run, but she couldn’t. She could take a 
Watschen from nuns and Rosas, but it hurt so much more from Papa. 
The hands were gone from Papa’s face now and he found the resolve 
to speak again. 

“You can say that in our house,” he said, looking gravely at Liesel’s 
cheek. “But you never say it on the street, at school, at the BDM, 
never!” He stood in front of her and lifted her by the triceps. He 
shook her. “Do you hear me?” 

With her eyes trapped wide open, Liesel nodded her compliance. 

It was, in fact, a rehearsal for a future lecture, when all of Hans 
Hubermann’s worst fears arrived on Himmel Street later that year, in 
the early hours of a November morning. 

“Good.” He placed her back down. “Now, let us try ...” At the 
bottom of the steps, Papa stood erect and cocked his arm. Forty-five 
degrees. “Heil Hitler.” 

Liesel stood up and also raised her arm. With absolute misery, she 
repeated it. “Heil Hitler.” It was quite a sight—an eleven-year-old girl, 
trying not to cry on the church steps, saluting the Fuhrer as the voices 
over Papa’s shoulder chopped and beat at the dark shape in the 
background. 

“Are we still friends?” 

Perhaps a quarter of an hour later, Papa held a cigarette olive 
branch in his palm—the paper and tobacco he’d just received. 
Without a word, Liesel reached gloomily across and proceeded to roll 
it. 
For quite a while, they sat there together. 

Smoke climbed over Papa’s shoulder. 

After another ten minutes, the gates of thievery would open just a 
crack, and Liesel Meminger would widen them a little further and 
squeeze through. 

e e « TWO QUESTIONS « « « 
Would the gates shut behind her? 
Or would they have the goodwill to let her back out? 

As Liesel would discover, a good thief requires many things. 
Stealth. Nerve. Speed. 

More important than any of those things, however, was one final 
requirement. 

Luck. 

Actually. 
Forget the ten minutes. 
The gates open now. 

BOOK OF FIRE 

The dark came in pieces, and with the cigarette brought to an end, 
Liesel and Hans Hubermann began to walk home. To get out of the 
square, they would walk past the bonfire site and through a small side 
road onto Munich Street. They didn’t make it that far. 

A middle-aged carpenter named Wolfgang Edel called out. He’d 
built the platforms for the Nazi big shots to stand on during the fire 
and he was in the process now of pulling them down. “Hans 
Hubermann?” He had long sideburns that pointed to his mouth and a 
dark voice. “Hansi!” 

“Hey, Wolfal,” Hans replied. There was an introduction to the girl 
and a “heil Hitler.” “Good, Liesel.” 

For the first few minutes, Liesel stayed within a five-meter radius of 
the conversation. Fragments came past her, but she didn’t pay too 
much attention. 

“Getting much work?” 

“No, it’s all tighter now. You know how it is, especially when 
you’re not a member.” 

“You told me you were joining, Hansi.” 
“T tried, but I made a mistake—I think they’re still considering.” 

Liesel wandered toward the mountain of ash. It sat like a magnet, like 
a freak. Irresistible to the eyes, similar to the road of yellow stars. 

As with her previous urge to see the mound’s ignition, she could 
not look away. All alone, she didn’t have the discipline to keep a safe 
distance. It sucked her toward it and she began to make her way 
around. 

Above her, the sky was completing its routine of darkening, but far 
away, over the mountain’s shoulder, there was a dull trace of light. 

“Pass auf, Kind,” a uniform said to her at one point. “Look out, 
child,” as he shoveled some more ash onto a cart. 

Closer to the town hall, under a light, some shadows stood and 
talked, most likely exulting in the success of the fire. From Liesel’s 
position, their voices were only sounds. Not words at all. 

For a few minutes, she watched the men shoveling up the pile, at 
first making it smaller at the sides to allow more of it to collapse. 
They came back and forth from a truck, and after three return trips, 
when the heap was reduced near the bottom, a small section of living 
material slipped from inside the ash. 

e © ¢ THE MATERIAL « « « 
Half a red flag, two posters advertising a Jewish poet, three 
books, and a wooden sign with something written on it in 
Hebrew 

Perhaps they were damp. Perhaps the fire didn’t burn long enough to 
fully reach the depth where they sat. Whatever the reason, they were 
huddled among the ashes, shaken. Survivors. 

“Three books.” Liesel spoke softly and she looked at the backs of 
the men. 

“Come on,” said one of them. “Hurry up, will you, I’m starving.” 
They moved toward the truck. 
The threesome of books poked their noses out. 
Liesel moved in. 

The heat was still strong enough to warm her when she stood at the 
foot of the ash heap. When she reached her hand in, she was bitten, 
but on the second attempt, she made sure she was fast enough. She 

latched onto the closest of the books. It was hot, but it was also wet, 
burned only at the edges, but otherwise unhurt. 

It was blue. 

The cover felt like it was woven with hundreds of tightly drawn 
strings and clamped down. Red letters were pressed into those fibers. 
The only word Liesel had time to read was Shoulder. There wasn’t 
enough time for the rest, and there was a problem. The smoke. 

Smoke lifted from the cover as she juggled it and hurried away. Her 
head was pulled down, and the sick beauty of nerves proved more 
ghastly with each stride. There were fourteen steps till the voice. 

It propped itself up behind her. 
“Hey!” 
That was when she nearly ran back and tossed the book onto the 

mound, but she was unable. The only movement at her disposal was 
the act of turning. 

“There are some things here that didn’t burn!” It was one of the 
cleanup men. He was not facing the girl, but rather, the people 
standing by the town hall. 

“Well, burn them again!” came the reply. “And watch them burn!” 
“T think they’re wet!” 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, do I have to do everything myself?” The 
sound of footsteps passed by. It was the mayor, wearing a black coat 
over his Nazi uniform. He didn’t notice the girl who stood absolutely 
still only a short distance away. 

e e e A REALIZATION « « « 
A statue of the book thief stood in the courtyard.... 
It’s very rare, don’t you think, for a statue to appear before its 
subject has become famous. 

She sank. 
The thrill of being ignored! 

The book felt cool enough now to slip inside her uniform. At first, it 
was nice and warm against her chest. As she began walking, though, 
it began to heat up again. 

By the time she made it back to Papa and Wolfgang Edel, the book 
was starting to burn her. It seemed to be igniting. 

Both men looked at her. 
She smiled. 

Immediately, when the smile shrank from her lips, she could feel 
something else. Or more to the point, someone else. There was no 
mistaking the watched feeling. It was all over her, and it was 
confirmed when she dared to face the shadows over at the town hall. 
To the side of the collection of silhouettes, another one stood, a few 
meters removed, and Liesel realized two things. 

e e eA FEW SMALL PIECES « « à 
OF RECOGNITION 
1. The shadow’s identity and 
2. The fact that it had seen everything 

The shadow’s hands were in its coat pockets. 
It had fluffy hair. 
If it had a face, the expression on it would have been one of injury. 

“Gottverdammt,” Liesel said, only loud enough for herself. 
“Goddamn it.” 

“Are we ready to go?” 
In the previous moments of stupendous danger, Papa had said 

goodbye to Wolfgang Edel and was ready to accompany Liesel home. 
“Ready,” she answered. 

They began to leave the scene of the crime, and the book was well 
and truly burning her now. The Shoulder Shrug had applied itself to 
her rib cage. 

As they walked past the precarious town hall shadows, the book 
thief winced. 

“What’s wrong?” Papa asked. 
“Nothing.” 
Quite a few things, however, were most definitely wrong: 
Smoke was rising out of Liesel’s collar. 
A necklace of sweat had formed around her throat. 
Beneath her shirt, a book was eating her up. 

PART THREE

the way home—a broken woman—a struggler— 
a juggler—the attributes of summer— 
an aryan shopkeeper—a snorer—two tricksters— 

and revenge in the shape of mixed candy 

THE WAY HOME 

Mein Kampf. 
The book penned by the Führer himself. 
It was the third book of great importance to reach Liesel Meminger; 
only this time, she did not steal it. The book showed up at 33 Himmel 
Street perhaps an hour after Liesel had drifted back to sleep from her 
obligatory nightmare. 
Some would say it was a miracle that she ever owned that book at 
all. 

Its journey began on the way home, the night of the fire. 

They were nearly halfway back to Himmel Street when Liesel could 
no longer take it. She bent over and removed the smoking book, 
allowing it to hop sheepishly from hand to hand. 
When it had cooled sufficiently, they both watched it a moment, 
waiting for the words. 
Papa: “What the hell do you call that?” 
He reached over and grabbed hold of The Shoulder Shrug. No 
explanation was required. It was obvious that the girl had stolen it 
from the fire. The book was hot and wet, blue and red—embarrassed 
—and Hans Hubermann opened it up. Pages thirty-eight and thirty- 
nine. “Another one?” 
Liesel rubbed her ribs. 
Yes. 
Another one. 
“Looks like,” Papa suggested, “I don’t need to trade any more 
cigarettes, do I? Not when you’re stealing these things as fast as I can 
buy them.” 

Liesel, by comparison, did not speak. Perhaps it was her first 
realization that criminality spoke best for itself. Irrefutable. 

Papa studied the title, probably wondering exactly what kind of 
threat this book posed to the hearts and minds of the German people. 
He handed it back. Something happened. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” Each word fell away at its edges. It 
broke off and formed the next. 

The criminal could no longer resist. “What, Papa? What is it?” 
“Of course.” 
Like most humans in the grip of revelation, Hans Hubermann stood 
with a certain numbness. The next words would either be shouted or 
would not make it past his teeth. Also, they would most likely be a 
repetition of the last thing he’d said, only moments earlier. 
“Of course.” 
This time, his voice was like a fist, freshly banged on the table. 
The man was seeing something. He was watching it quickly, end to 
end, like a race, but it was too high and too far away for Liesel to see. 
She begged him. “Come on, Papa, what is it?” She fretted that he 
would tell Mama about the book. As humans do, this was all about 
her. “Are you going to tell?” 
“Sorry?” 
“You know. Are you going to tell Mama?” 
Hans Hubermann still watched, tall and distant. “About what?” 
She raised the book. “This.” She brandished it in the air, as if 
waving a gun. 
Papa was bewildered. “Why would I?” 
She hated questions like that. They forced her to admit an ugly 
truth, to reveal her own filthy, thieving nature. “Because I stole 
again.” 
Papa bent himself to a crouching position, then rose and placed his 
hand on her head. He stroked her hair with his rough, long fingers 

and said, “Of course not, Liesel. You are safe.” 
“So what are you going to do?” 
That was the question. 

What marvelous act was Hans Hubermann about to produce from 
the thin Munich Street air? 

Before I show you, I think we should first take a look at what he 
was seeing prior to his decision. 

e e e PAPA’S FAST-PACED VISIONS « « « 
First, he sees the girl’s books: The Grave Digger’s Handbook, Faust 
the Dog, The Lighthouse, and now The Shoulder Shrug. Next is a 
kitchen and a volatile Hans Junior, regarding those books on the 
table, where the girl often reads. He speaks: “And what trash is 
this girl reading?” His son repeats the question three times, after 
which he makes his suggestion for more appropriate reading 
material. 

“Listen, Liesel.” Papa placed his arm around her and walked her on. 
“This is our secret, this book. We’ll read it at night or in the 
basement, just like the others—but you have to promise me 
something.” 

“Anything, Papa.” 
The night was smooth and still. Everything listened. “If I ever ask 
you to keep a secret for me, you will do it.” 
“I promise.” 

“Good. Now come on. If we’re any later, Mama will kill us, and we 
don’t want that, do we? No more book stealing then, huh?” 

Liesel grinned. 

What she didn’t know until later was that within the next few days, 
her foster father managed to trade some cigarettes for another book, 

although this one was not for her. He knocked on the door of the Nazi 
Party office in Molching and took the opportunity to ask about his 
membership application. Once this was discussed, he proceeded to 
give them his last scraps of money and a dozen cigarettes. In return, 
he received a used copy of Mein Kampf. 

“Happy reading,” said one of the party members. 
“Thank you.” Hans nodded. 

From the street, he could still hear the men inside. One of the 
voices was particularly clear. “He will never be approved,” it said, 
“even if he buys a hundred copies of Mein Kampf.” The statement was 
unanimously agreed upon. 

Hans held the book in his right hand, thinking about postage 
money, a cigaretteless existence, and the foster daughter who had 
given him this brilliant idea. 

“Thank you,” he repeated, to which a passerby inquired as to what 
he’d said. 

With typical affability, Hans replied, “Nothing, my good man, 
nothing at all. Heil Hitler,” and he walked down Munich Street, 
holding the pages of the Fuhrer. 

There must have been a good share of mixed feelings at that 
moment, for Hans Hubermann’s idea had not only sprung from Liesel, 
but from his son. Did he already fear he’d never see him again? On 
the other hand, he was also enjoying the ecstasy of an idea, not 
daring just yet to envision its complications, dangers, and vicious 
absurdities. For now, the idea was enough. It was indestructible. 
Transforming it into reality, well, that was something else altogether. 
For now, though, let’s let him enjoy it. 

We'll give him seven months. 
Then we come for him. 
And oh, how we come. 

THE MAYOR’S LIBRARY 

Certainly, something of great magnitude was coming toward 33 
Himmel Street, to which Liesel was currently oblivious. To distort an 
overused human expression, the girl had more immediate fish to fry: 

She had stolen a book. 
Someone had seen her. 
The book thief reacted. Appropriately. 

Every minute, every hour, there was worry, or more to the point, 
paranoia. Criminal activity will do that to a person, especially a child. 
They envision a prolific assortment of caughtoutedness. Some 
examples: People jumping out of alleys. Schoolteachers suddenly 
being aware of every sin you’ve ever committed. Police showing up at 
the door each time a leaf turns or a distant gate slams shut. 

For Liesel, the paranoia itself became the punishment, as did the 
dread of delivering some washing to the mayor’s house. It was no 
mistake, as I’m sure you can imagine, that when the time came, Liesel 
conveniently overlooked the house on Grande Strasse. She delivered 
to the arthritic Helena Schmidt and picked up at the cat-loving 
Weingartner residence, but she ignored the house belonging to 
Burgermeister Heinz Hermann and his wife, Ilsa. 

e « e ANOTHER QUICK TRANSLATION = « « 
Burgermeister = mayor 

On the first occasion, she stated that she simply forgot about that 
place—a poor excuse if ever I’ve heard one—as the house straddled 
the hill, overlooking the town, and it was unforgettable. When she 

went back and still returned empty-handed, she lied that there was no 
one home. 

“No one home?” Mama was skeptical. Skepticism gave her an itch 
for the wooden spoon. She waved it at Liesel and said, “Get back over 
there now, and if you don’t come home with the washing, don’t come 
home at all.” 

“Really?” 

That was Rudy’s response when Liesel told him what Mama had 
said. “Do you want to run away together?” 

“We'll starve.” 
“Pm starving anyway!” They laughed. 
“No,” she said, “I have to do it.” 

They walked the town as they usually did when Rudy came along. 
He always tried to be a gentleman and carry the bag, but each time, 
Liesel refused. Only she had the threat of a Watschen loitering over 
her head, and therefore only she could be relied upon to carry the bag 
correctly. Anyone else was more likely to manhandle it, twist it, or 
mistreat it in even the most minimal way, and it was not worth the 
risk. Also, it was likely that if she allowed Rudy to carry it for her, he 
would expect a kiss for his services, and that was not an option. 
Besides, she was accustomed to its burden. She would swap the bag 
from shoulder to shoulder, relieving each side every hundred steps or 
sO. 

Liesel walked on the left, Rudy the right. Rudy talked most of the 
time, about the last soccer match on Himmel Street, working in his 
father’s shop, and whatever else came to mind. Liesel tried to listen 
but failed. What she heard was the dread, chiming through her ears, 
growing louder the closer they stepped toward Grande Strasse. 

“What are you doing? Isn’t this it?” 

Liesel nodded that Rudy was right, for she had tried to walk past 
the mayor’s house to buy some time. 

“Well, go on,” the boy hurried her. Molching was darkening. The 
cold was climbing out of the ground. “Move it, Saumensch.” He 
remained at the gate. 

After the path, there were eight steps up to the main entrance of the 
house, and the great door was like a monster. Liesel frowned at the 
brass knocker. 

“What are you waiting for?” Rudy called out. 

Liesel turned and faced the street. Was there any way, any way at 
all, for her to evade this? Was there another story, or let’s face it, 
another lie, that she’d overlooked? 

“We don’t have all day.” Rudy’s distant voice again. “What the hell 
are you waiting for?” 
“Will you shut your trap, Steiner?” It was a shout delivered as a 
whisper. 
“What?” 
“T said shut up, you stupid Saukerl ....” 

With that, she faced the door again, lifted back the brass knuckle, 
and tapped it three times, slowly. Feet approached from the other 
side. 

At first, she didn’t look at the woman but focused on the washing 
bag in her hand. She examined the drawstring as she passed it over. 
Money was handed out to her and then, nothing. The mayor’s wife, 
who never spoke, simply stood in her bathrobe, her soft fluffy hair 
tied back into a short tail. A draft made itself known. Something like 
the imagined breath of a corpse. Still there were no words, and when 
Liesel found the courage to face her, the woman wore an expression 
not of reproach, but utter distance. For a moment, she looked over 
Liesel’s shoulder at the boy, then nodded and stepped back, closing 
the door. 

For quite a while, Liesel remained, facing the blanket of upright 
wood. 

“Hey, Saumensch!” No response. “Liesel!” 
Liesel reversed. 
Cautiously. 
She took the first few steps backward, calculating. 

Perhaps the woman hadn’t seen her steal the book after all. It had 
been getting dark. Perhaps it was one of those times when a person 
appears to be looking directly at you when, in fact, they’re 
contentedly watching something else or simply daydreaming. 
Whatever the answer, Liesel didn’t attempt any further analysis. She’d 
gotten away with it and that was enough. 

She turned and handled the remainder of the steps normally, taking 
the last three all at once. 

“Let’s go, Saukerl.” She even allowed herself a laugh. Eleven-year- 
old paranoia was powerful. Eleven-year-old relief was euphoric. 

e © eA LITTLE SOMETHING TO « « « 
DAMPEN THE EUPHORIA 
She had gotten away with nothing. 
The mayor’s wife had seen her, all right. 
She was just waiting for the right moment. 

A few weeks passed. 
Soccer on Himmel Street. 

Reading The Shoulder Shrug between two and three o’clock each 
morning, post-nightmare, or during the afternoon, in the basement. 

Another benign visit to the mayor’s house. 
All was lovely. 
Until. 

When Liesel next visited, minus Rudy, the opportunity presented 
itself. It was a pickup day. 

The mayor’s wife opened the door and she was not holding the bag, 
like she normally would. Instead, she stepped aside and motioned 
with her chalky hand and wrist for the girl to enter. 

“Tm just here for the washing.” Liesel’s blood had dried inside of 
her. It crumbled. She almost broke into pieces on the steps. 

The woman said her first word to her then. She reached out, cold- 
fingered, and said, “Warte—wait.” When she was sure the girl had 
steadied, she turned and walked hastily back inside. 

“Thank God,” Liesel exhaled. “She’s getting it.” It being the 
washing. 

What the woman returned with, however, was nothing of the sort. 

When she came and stood with an impossibly frail steadfastness, 
she was holding a tower of books against her stomach, from her navel 
to the beginnings of her breasts. She looked so vulnerable in the 
monstrous doorway. Long, light eyelashes and just the slightest 
twinge of expression. A suggestion. 

Come and see, it said. 

She’s going to torture me, Liesel decided. She’s going to take me 
inside, light the fireplace, and throw me in, books and all. Or she'll 
lock me in the basement without any food. 

For some reason, though—most likely the lure of the books—she 
found herself walking in. The squeaking of her shoes on the wooden 
floorboards made her cringe, and when she hit a sore spot, inducing 
the wood to groan, she almost stopped. The mayor’s wife was not 
deterred. She only looked briefly behind and continued on, to a 
chestnut-colored door. Now her face asked a question. 

Are you ready? 

Liesel craned her neck a little, as if she might see over the door that 
stood in her way. Clearly, that was the cue to open it. 

“Jesus, Mary ...” 

She said it out loud, the words distributed into a room that was full of 
cold air and books. Books everywhere! Each wall was armed with 
overcrowded yet immaculate shelving. It was barely possible to see 
the paintwork. There were all different styles and sizes of lettering on 
the spines of the black, the red, the gray, the every-colored books. It 
was one of the most beautiful things Liesel Meminger had ever seen. 

With wonder, she smiled. 
That such a room existed! 

Even when she tried to wipe the smile away with her forearm, she 
realized instantly that it was a pointless exercise. She could feel the 
eyes of the woman traveling her body, and when she looked at her, 
they had rested on her face. 

There was more silence than she ever thought possible. It extended 
like an elastic, dying to break. The girl broke it. 

“Can I?” 

The two words stood among acres and acres of vacant, wooden- 
floored land. The books were miles away. 

The woman nodded. 
Yes, you can. 

Steadily, the room shrank, till the book thief could touch the shelves 
within a few small steps. She ran the back of her hand along the first 
shelf, listening to the shuffle of her fingernails gliding across the 
spinal cord of each book. It sounded like an instrument, or the notes 
of running feet. She used both hands. She raced them. One shelf 
against the other. And she laughed. Her voice was sprawled out, high 
in her throat, and when she eventually stopped and stood in the 
middle of the room, she spent many minutes looking from the shelves 

to her fingers and back again. 
How many books had she touched? 
How many had she felt? 

She walked over and did it again, this time much slower, with her 
hand facing forward, allowing the dough of her palm to feel the small 
hurdle of each book. It felt like magic, like beauty, as bright lines of 
light shone down from a chandelier. Several times, she almost pulled 
a title from its place but didn’t dare disturb them. They were too 
perfect. 

To her left, she saw the woman again, standing by a large desk, still 
holding the small tower against her torso. She stood with a delighted 
crookedness. A smile appeared to have paralyzed her lips. 

“Do you want me to—?” 

Liesel didn’t finish the question but actually performed what she 
was going to ask, walking over and taking the books gently from the 
woman’s arms. She then placed them into the missing piece in the 
shelf, by the slightly open window. The outside cold was streaming 
in. 

For a moment, she considered closing it, but thought better of it. 
This was not her house, and the situation was not to be tampered 
with. Instead, she returned to the lady behind her, whose smile gave 
the appearance now of a bruise and whose arms were hanging 
slenderly at each side. Like girls’ arms. 

What now? 

An awkwardness treated itself to the room, and Liesel took a final, 
fleeting glance at the walls of books. In her mouth, the words 
fidgeted, but they came out in a rush. “I should go.” 

It took three attempts to leave. 

She waited in the hallway for a few minutes, but the woman didn’t 
come, and when Liesel returned to the entrance of the room, she saw 
her sitting at the desk, staring blankly at one of the books. She chose 

not to disturb her. In the hallway, she picked up the washing. 

This time, she avoided the sore spot in the floorboards, walking the 
long length of the corridor, favoring the left-hand wall. When she 
closed the door behind her, a brass clank sounded in her ear, and 
with the washing next to her, she stroked the flesh of the wood. “Get 
going,” she said. 

At first, she walked home dazed. 

The surreal experience with the roomful of books and the stunned, 
broken woman walked alongside her. She could see it on the 
buildings, like a play. Perhaps it was similar to the way Papa had his 
Mein Kampf revelation. Wherever she looked, Liesel saw the mayor’s 
wife with the books piled up in her arms. Around corners, she could 
hear the shuffle of her own hands, disturbing the shelves. She saw the 
open window, the chandelier of lovely light, and she saw herself 
leaving, without so much as a word of thanks. 

Soon, her sedated condition transformed to harassment and self- 
loathing. She began to rebuke herself. 

“You said nothing.” Her head shook vigorously, among the hurried 
footsteps. “Not a ‘goodbye.’ Not a ‘thank you.’ Not a ‘that’s the most 
beautiful sight I’ve ever seen.’ Nothing!” Certainly, she was a book 
thief, but that didn’t mean she should have no manners at all. It 
didn’t mean she couldn’t be polite. 
She walked a good few minutes, struggling with indecision. 
On Munich Street, it came to an end. 
Just as she could make out the sign that said STEINER—SCHNEIDERMEISTER, 
she turned and ran back. 
This time, there was no hesitation. 
She thumped the door, sending an echo of brass through the wood. 
Scheisse! 

It was not the mayor’s wife, but the mayor himself who stood 
before her. In her hurry, Liesel had neglected to notice the car that sat 

out front, on the street. 
Mustached and black-suited, the man spoke. “Can I help you?” 

Liesel could say nothing. Not yet. She was bent over, short of air, 
and fortunately, the woman arrived when she’d at least partially 
recovered. Ilsa Hermann stood behind her husband, to the side. 

“T forgot,” Liesel said. She lifted the bag and addressed the mayor’s 
wife. Despite the forced labor of breath, she fed the words through 
the gap in the doorway—between the mayor and the frame—to the 
woman. Such was her effort to breathe that the words escaped only a 
few at a time. “I forgot ... I mean, I just ... wanted,” she said, “to ... 
thank you.” 

The mayor’s wife bruised herself again. Coming forward to stand 
beside her husband, she nodded very faintly, waited, and closed the 
door. 

It took Liesel a minute or so to leave. 
She smiled at the steps. 

ENTER THE STRUGGLER 

Now for a change of scenery. 

We’ve both had it too easy till now, my friend, don’t you think? 
How about we forget Molching for a minute or two? 

It will do us some good. 
Also, it’s important to the story. 

We will travel a little, to a secret storage room, and we will see 
what we see. 

e © eA GUIDED TOUR OF SUFFERING « « « 
To your left, 
perhaps your right, 
perhaps even straight ahead, 
you find a small black room. 
In it sits a Jew. 
He is scum. 
He is starving. 
He is afraid. 
Please—try not to look away. 

A few hundred miles northwest, in Stuttgart, far from book thieves, 
mayors’ wives, and Himmel Street, a man was sitting in the dark. It 
was the best place, they decided. It’s harder to find a Jew in the dark. 

He sat on his suitcase, waiting. How many days had it been now? 

He had eaten only the foul taste of his own hungry breath for what 
felt like weeks, and still, nothing. Occasionally voices wandered past 
and sometimes he longed for them to knuckle the door, to open it, to 
drag him out, into the unbearable light. For now, he could only sit on 
his suitcase couch, hands under his chin, his elbows burning his 
thighs. 

There was sleep, starving sleep, and the irritation of half awakeness, 
and the punishment of the floor. 

Ignore the itchy feet. 
Don’t scratch the soles. 
And don’t move too much. 

Just leave everything as it is, at all cost. It might be time to go 
soon. Light like a gun. Explosive to the eyes. It might be time to go. It 
might be time, so wake up. Wake up now, Goddamn it! Wake up. 

The door was opened and shut, and a figure was crouched over him. 
The hand splashed at the cold waves of his clothes and the grimy 
currents beneath. A voice came down, behind it. 

“Max,” it whispered. “Max, wake up.” 

His eyes did not do anything that shock normally describes. No 
snapping, no slapping, no jolt. Those things happen when you wake 
from a bad dream, not when you wake into one. No, his eyes dragged 
themselves open, from darkness to dim. It was his body that reacted, 
shrugging upward and throwing out an arm to grip the air. 

The voice calmed him now. “Sorry it’s taken so long. I think people 
have been watching me. And the man with the identity card took 
longer than I thought, but—” There was a pause. “It’s yours now. Not 
great quality, but hopefully good enough to get you there if it comes 
to that.” He crouched down and waved a hand at the suitcase. In his 
other hand, he held something heavy and flat. “Come on—off.” Max 
obeyed, standing and scratching. He could feel the tightening of his 

bones. “The card is in this.” It was a book. “You should put the map 
in here, too, and the directions. And there’s a key—taped to the inside 
cover.” He clicked open the case as quietly as he could and planted 
the book like a bomb. “T’ll be back in a few days.” 

He left a small bag filled with bread, fat, and three small carrots. 
Next to it was a bottle of water. There was no apology. “It’s the best I 
could do.” 

Door open, door shut. 
Alone again. 

What came to him immediately then was the sound. 

Everything was so desperately noisy in the dark when he was alone. 
Each time he moved, there was the sound of a crease. He felt like a 
man in a paper suit. 

The food. 

Max divided the bread into three parts and set two aside. The one in 
his hand he immersed himself in, chewing and gulping, forcing it 
down the dry corridor of his throat. The fat was cold and hard, 
scaling its way down, occasionally holding on. Big swallows tore 
them away and sent them below. 

Then the carrots. 

Again, he set two aside and devoured the third. The noise was 
astounding. Surely, the Fuhrer himself could hear the sound of the 
orange crush in his mouth. It broke his teeth with every bite. When 
he drank, he was quite positive that he was swallowing them. Next 
time, he advised himself, drink first. 

Later, to his relief, when the echoes left him and he found the 
courage to check with his fingers, each tooth was still there, intact. 
He tried for a smile, but it didn’t come. He could only imagine a meek 

attempt and a mouthful of broken teeth. For hours, he felt at them. 
He opened the suitcase and picked up the book. 

He could not read the title in the dark, and the gamble of striking a 
match seemed too great right now. 

When he spoke, it was the taste of a whisper. 
“Please,” he said. “Please.” 

He was speaking to a man he had never met. As well as a few other 
important details, he knew the man’s name. Hans Hubermann. Again, 
he spoke to him, to the distant stranger. He pleaded. 

“Please.” 

THE ATTRIBUTES OF SUMMER 

So there you have it. 

You’re well aware of exactly what was coming to Himmel Street by 
the end of 1940. 

I know. 
You know. 
Liesel Meminger, however, cannot be put into that category. 

For the book thief, the summer of that year was simple. It consisted 
of four main elements, or attributes. At times, she would wonder 
which was the most powerful. 

e e e AND THE NOMINEES ARE ... « « « 
1. Advancing through The Shoulder Shrug every night. 
2. Reading on the floor of the mayor’s library. 
3. Playing soccer on Himmel Street. 

4. The seizure of a different stealing opportunity. 

The Shoulder Shrug, she decided, was excellent. Each night, when she 
calmed herself from her nightmare, she was soon pleased that she was 
awake and able to read. “A few pages?” Papa asked her, and Liesel 
would nod. Sometimes they would complete a chapter the next 
afternoon, down in the basement. 

The authorities’ problem with the book was obvious. The 
protagonist was a Jew, and he was presented in a positive light. 
Unforgivable. He was a rich man who was tired of letting life pass 
him by—what he referred to as the shrugging of the shoulders to the 
problems and pleasures of a person’s time on earth. 

In the early part of summer in Molching, as Liesel and Papa made 
their way through the book, this man was traveling to Amsterdam on 
business, and the snow was shivering outside. The girl loved that— 
the shivering snow. “That’s exactly what it does when it comes 
down,” she told Hans Hubermann. They sat together on the bed, Papa 
half asleep and the girl wide awake. 

Sometimes she watched Papa as he slept, knowing both more and 
less about him than either of them realized. She often heard him and 
Mama discussing his lack of work or talking despondently about Hans 
going to see their son, only to discover that the young man had left 
his lodging and was most likely already on his way to war. 

“Schlaf gut, Papa,” the girl said at those times. “Sleep well,” and she 
slipped around him, out of bed, to turn off the light. 

The next attribute, as I’ve mentioned, was the mayor’s library. 

To exemplify that particular situation, we can look to a cool day in 
late June. Rudy, to put it mildly, was incensed. 

Who did Liesel Meminger think she was, telling him she had to take 
the washing and ironing alone today? Wasn’t he good enough to walk 
the streets with her? 

“Stop complaining, Saukerl,” she reprimanded him. “I just feel bad. 
You're missing the game.” 

He looked over his shoulder. “Well, if you put it like that.” There 
was a Schmunzel. “You can stick your washing.” He ran off and 
wasted no time joining a team. When Liesel made it to the top of 
Himmel Street, she looked back just in time to see him standing in 
front of the nearest makeshift goals. He was waving. 

“Saukerl,” she laughed, and as she held up her hand, she knew 
completely that he was simultaneously calling her a Saumensch. I 
think that’s as close to love as eleven-year-olds can get. 

She started to run, to Grande Strasse and the mayor’s house. 

Certainly, there was sweat, and the wrinkled pants of breath, 
stretching out in front of her. 

But she was reading. 

The mayor’s wife, having let the girl in for the fourth time, was 
sitting at the desk, simply watching the books. On the second visit, 
she had given permission for Liesel to pull one out and go through it, 
which led to another and another, until up to half a dozen books were 
stuck to her, either clutched beneath her arm or among the pile that 
was climbing higher in her remaining hand. 

On this occasion, as Liesel stood in the cool surrounds of the room, 
her stomach growled, but no reaction was forthcoming from the 
mute, damaged woman. She was in her bathrobe again, and although 
she observed the girl several times, it was never for very long. She 
usually paid more attention to what was next to her, to something 
missing. The window was opened wide, a square cool mouth, with 
occasional gusty surges. 

Liesel sat on the floor. The books were scattered around her. 
After forty minutes, she left. Every title was returned to its place. 

“Goodbye, Frau Hermann.” The words always came as a shock. 
“Thank you.” After which the woman paid her and she left. Every 
movement was accounted for, and the book thief ran home. 

As summer set in, the roomful of books became warmer, and with 
every pickup or delivery day the floor was not as painful. Liesel 
would sit with a small pile of books next to her, and she’d read a few 
paragraphs of each, trying to memorize the words she didn’t know, to 
ask Papa when she made it home. Later on, as an adolescent, when 
Liesel wrote about those books, she no longer remembered the titles. 
Not one. Perhaps had she stolen them, she would have been better 
equipped. 
What she did remember was that one of the picture books had a 
name written clumsily on the inside cover: 

e e ¢ THE NAME OF A BOY « « « 
Johann Hermann 

Liesel bit down on her lip, but she could not resist it for long. From 
the floor, she turned and looked up at the bathrobed woman and 
made an inquiry. “Johann Hermann,” she said. “Who is that?” 

The woman looked beside her, somewhere next to the girl’s knees. 

Liesel apologized. “Im sorry. I shouldn’t be asking such things ....” 
She let the sentence die its own death. 

The woman’s face did not alter, yet somehow she managed to 
speak. “He is nothing now in this world,” she explained. “He was my 

99 
oe 

e e e THE FILES OF RECOLLECTION « « « 
Oh, yes, I definitely remember him. 
The sky was murky and deep like quicksand. 
There was a young man parceled up in barbed wire, like a giant 
crown of thorns. I untangled him and carried him out. High 
above the earth, we sank together, to our knees. It was just 
another day, 1918. 

“Apart from everything else,” she said, “he froze to death.” For a 
moment, she played with her hands, and she said it again. “He froze 
to death, I’m sure of it.” 

The mayor’s wife was just one of a worldwide brigade. You have seen 
her before, Pm certain. In your stories, your poems, the screens you 
like to watch. They’re everywhere, so why not here? Why not on a 

shapely hill in a small German town? It’s as good a place to suffer as 
any. 
The point is, Ilsa Hermann had decided to make suffering her 
triumph. When it refused to let go of her, she succumbed to it. She 
embraced it. 

She could have shot herself, scratched herself, or indulged in other 
forms of self-mutilation, but she chose what she probably felt was the 
weakest option—to at least endure the discomfort of the weather. For 
all Liesel knew, she prayed for summer days that were cold and wet. 
For the most part, she lived in the right place. 

When Liesel left that day, she said something with great uneasiness. 
In translation, two giant words were struggled with, carried on her 
shoulder, and dropped as a bungling pair at Ilsa Hermann’s feet. They 
fell off sideways as the girl veered with them and could no longer 
sustain their weight. Together, they sat on the floor, large and loud 
and clumsy. 

e « « TWO GIANT WORDS « « « 

I’m Sorry 

Again, the mayor’s wife watched the space next to her. A blank-page 
face. 

“For what?” she asked, but time had elapsed by then. The girl was 
already well out of the room. She was nearly at the front door. When 
she heard it, Liesel stopped, but she chose not to go back, preferring 
to make her way noiselessly from the house and down the steps. She 
took in the view of Molching before disappearing down into it, and 
she pitied the mayor’s wife for quite a while. 

At times, Liesel wondered if she should simply leave the woman 
alone, but Ilsa Hermann was too interesting, and the pull of the books 
was too strong. Once, words had rendered Liesel useless, but now, 
when she sat on the floor, with the mayor’s wife at her husband’s 
desk, she felt an innate sense of power. It happened every time she 

deciphered a new word or pieced together a sentence. 
She was a girl. 
In Nazi Germany. 
How fitting that she was discovering the power of words. 

And how awful (and yet exhilarating!) it would feel many months 
later, when she would unleash the power of this newfound discovery 
the very moment the mayor’s wife let her down. How quickly the pity 
would leave her, and how quickly it would spill over into something 
else completely .... 

Now, though, in the summer of 1940, she could not see what lay 
ahead, in more ways than one. She was witness only to a sorrowful 
woman with a roomful of books whom she enjoyed visiting. That was 
all. It was part two of her existence that summer. 

Part three, thank God, was a little more lighthearted—Himmel 
Street soccer. 

Allow me to play you a picture: 
Feet scuffing road. 
The rush of boyish breath. 
Shouted words: “Here! This way! Scheisse!” 
The coarse bounce of ball on road. 

All were present on Himmel Street, as well as the sound of apologies, 
as summer further intensified. 

The apologies belonged to Liesel Meminger. 
They were directed at Tommy Müller. 

By the start of July, she finally managed to convince him that she 
wasn’t going to kill him. Since the beating she’d handed him the 
previous November, Tommy was still frightened to be around her. In 

the soccer meetings on Himmel Street, he kept well clear. “You never 
know when she might snap,” he’d confided in Rudy, half twitching, 
half speaking. 

In Liesel’s defense, she never gave up on trying to put him at ease. 
It disappointed her that she’d successfully made peace with Ludwig 
Schmeikl and not with the innocent Tommy Muller. He still cowered 
slightly whenever he saw her. 

“How could I know you were smiling for me that day?” she asked 
him repeatedly. 

She’d even put in a few stints as goalie for him, until everyone else 
on the team begged him to go back in. 

“Get back in there!” a boy named Harald Mollenhauer finally 
ordered him. “You're useless.” This was after Tommy tripped him up 
as he was about to score. He would have awarded himself a penalty 
but for the fact that they were on the same side. 

Liesel came back out and would somehow always end up opposing 
Rudy. They would tackle and trip each other, call each other names. 
Rudy would commentate: “She can’t get around him this time, the 
stupid Saumensch Arschgrobbler. She hasn’t got a hope.” He seemed to 
enjoy calling Liesel an ass scratcher. It was one of the joys of 
childhood. 

Another of the joys, of course, was stealing. Part four, summer 1940. 

In fairness, there were many things that brought Rudy and Liesel 
together, but it was the stealing that cemented their friendship 
completely. It was brought about by one opportunity, and it was 
driven by one inescapable force—Rudy’s hunger. The boy was 
permanently dying for something to eat. 

On top of the rationing situation, his father’s business wasn’t doing 
so well of late (the threat of Jewish competition was taken away, but 
so were the Jewish customers). The Steiners were scratching things 
together to get by. Like many other people on the Himmel Street side 
of town, they needed to trade. Liesel would have given him some 

food from her place, but there wasn’t an abundance of it there, either. 
Mama usually made pea soup. On Sunday nights she cooked it—and 
not just enough for one or two repeat performances. She made 
enough pea soup to last until the following Saturday. Then on 
Sunday, she’d cook another one. Pea soup, bread, sometimes a small 
portion of potatoes or meat. You ate it up and you didn’t ask for 
more, and you didn’t complain. 

At first, they did things to try to forget about it. 

Rudy wouldn’t be hungry if they played soccer on the street. Or if 
they took bikes from his brother and sister and rode to Alex Steiner’s 
shop or visited Liesel’s papa, if he was working that particular day. 
Hans Hubermann would sit with them and tell jokes in the last light 
of afternoon. 

With the arrival of a few hot days, another distraction was learning 
to swim in the Amper River. The water was still a little too cold, but 
they went anyway. 
“Come on,” Rudy coaxed her in. “Just here. It isn’t so deep here.” 
She couldn’t see the giant hole she was walking into and sank straight 
to the bottom. Dog-paddling saved her life, despite nearly choking on 
the swollen intake of water. 
“You Saukerl,” she accused him when she collapsed onto the 
riverbank. 

Rudy made certain to keep well away. He’d seen what she did to 
Ludwig Schmeikl. “You can swim now, can’t you?” 

Which didn’t particularly cheer her up as she marched away. Her 
hair was pasted to the side of her face and snot was flowing from her 
nose. 

He called after her. “Does this mean I don’t get a kiss for teaching 
you?” 
“Saukerl!” 

The nerve of him! 

It was inevitable. 

The depressing pea soup and Rudy’s hunger finally drove them to 
thievery. It inspired their attachment to an older group of kids who 
stole from the farmers. Fruit stealers. After a game of soccer, both 
Liesel and Rudy learned the benefits of keeping their eyes open. 
Sitting on Rudy’s front step, they noticed Fritz Hammer—one of their 
older counterparts—eating an apple. It was of the Klar variety— 
ripening in July and August—and it looked magnificent in his hand. 
Three or four more of them clearly bulged in his jacket pockets. They 
wandered closer. 

“Where did you get those?” Rudy asked. 

The boy only grinned at first. “Shhh,” and he stopped. He then 
proceeded to pull an apple from his pocket and toss it over. “Just look 
at it,” he warned them. “Don’t eat it.” 

The next time they saw the same boy wearing the same jacket, on a 
day that was too warm for it, they followed him. He led them toward 
the upstream section of the Amper River. It was close to where Liesel 
sometimes read with her papa when she was first learning. 

A group of five boys, some lanky, a few short and lean, stood 
waiting. 

There were a few such groups in Molching at the time, some with 
members as young as six. The leader of this particular outfit was an 
agreeable fifteen-year-old criminal named Arthur Berg. He looked 
around and saw the two eleven-year-olds dangling off the back. 
“Und?” he asked. “And?” 

“Pm starving,” Rudy replied. 
“And he’s fast,” said Liesel. 
Berg looked at her. “I don’t recall asking for your opinion.” He was 
teenage tall and had a long neck. Pimples were gathered in peer 

groups on his face. “But I like you.” He was friendly, in a smart- 
mouth adolescent way. “Isn’t this the one who beat up your brother, 

Anderl?” Word had certainly made its way around. A good hiding 
transcends the divides of age. 

Another boy—one of the short, lean ones—with shaggy blond hair 
and ice-colored skin, looked over. “I think so.” 

Rudy confirmed it. “It is.” 

Andy Schmeikl walked across and studied her, up and down, his 
face pensive before breaking into a gaping smile. “Great work, kid.” 
He even slapped her among the bones of her back, catching a sharp 
piece of shoulder blade. “I’d get whipped for it if I did it myself.” 

Arthur had moved on to Rudy. “And you’re the Jesse Owens one, 
aren’t you?” 
Rudy nodded. 

“Clearly,” said Arthur, “you’re an idiot—but you’re our kind of 
idiot. Come on.” They were in. 

When they reached the farm, Liesel and Rudy were thrown a sack. 
Arthur Berg gripped his own burlap bag. He ran a hand through his 
mild strands of hair. “Either of you ever stolen before?” 

99 

“Of course, 
convincing. 

Rudy certified. “All the time.” He was not very 

Liesel was more specific. “I’ve stolen two books,” at which Arthur 
laughed, in three short snorts. His pimples shifted position. 

“You can’t eat books, sweetheart.” 

From there, they all examined the apple trees, who stood in long, 
twisted rows. Arthur Berg gave the orders. “One,” he said. “Don’t get 
caught on the fence. You get caught on the fence, you get left behind. 
Understood?” Everyone nodded or said yes. “Two. One in the tree, 
one below. Someone has to collect.” He rubbed his hands together. 
He was enjoying this. “Three. If you see someone coming, you call out 
loud enough to wake the dead—and we all run. Richtig?” 

“Richtig.” It was a chorus. 

e © ¢ TWO DEBUTANT APPLE THIEVES, « « « 
WHISPERING 
“Liesel—are you sure? Do you still want to do this?” 
“Look at the barbed wire, Rudy. It’s so high.” 
“No, no, look, you throw the sack on. See? Like them.” 
“All right.” 
“Come on then!” 
“T can’t!” Hesitation. “Rudy, I—” 
“Move it, Saumensch!” 

He pushed her toward the fence, threw the empty sack on the wire, 
and they climbed over, running toward the others. Rudy made his 
way up the closest tree and started flinging down the apples. Liesel 
stood below, putting them into the sack. By the time it was full, there 
was another problem. 

“How do we get back over the fence?” 

The answer came when they noticed Arthur Berg climbing as close 
to a fence post as possible. “The wire’s stronger there.” Rudy pointed. 
He threw the sack over, made Liesel go first, then landed beside her 
on the other side, among the fruit that spilled from the bag. 

Next to them, the long legs of Arthur Berg stood watching in 
amusement. 

“Not bad,” landed the voice from above. “Not bad at all.” 

When they made it back to the river, hidden among the trees, he 
took the sack and gave Liesel and Rudy a dozen apples between them. 

“Good work,” was his final comment on the matter. 

That afternoon, before they returned home, Liesel and Rudy 

consumed six apples apiece within half an hour. At first, they 
entertained thoughts of sharing the fruit at their respective homes, 
but there was considerable danger in that. They didn’t particularly 
relish the opportunity of explaining just where the fruit had come 
from. Liesel even thought that perhaps she could get away with only 
telling Papa, but she didn’t want him thinking that he had a 
compulsive criminal on his hands. So she ate. 

On the riverbank where she learned to swim, each apple was 
disposed of. Unaccustomed to such luxury, they knew it was likely 
they’d be sick. 

They ate anyway. 

“Saumensch!” Mama abused her that night. “Why are you vomiting so 
much?” 

“Maybe it’s the pea soup,” Liesel suggested. 

“That’s right,” Papa echoed. He was over at the window again. “It 
must be. I feel a bit sick myself.” 

“Who asked you, Saukerl?” Quickly, she turned back to face the 
vomiting Saumensch. “Well? What is it? What is it, you filthy pig?” 

But Liesel? 
She said nothing. 

The apples, she thought happily. The apples, and she vomited one 
more time, for luck. 

THE ARYAN SHOPKEEPER 

They stood outside Frau Diller’s, against the whitewashed wall. 
A piece of candy was in Liesel Meminger’s mouth. 
The sun was in her eyes. 
Despite these difficulties, she was still able to speak and argue. 

e © e ANOTHER CONVERSATION « « « 
BETWEEN RUDY AND LIESEL 
“Hurry up, Saumensch, that’s ten already.” 
“It’s not, it’s only eight—I’ve got two to go.” 
“Well, hurry up, then. I told you we should have gotten a knife 
and sawn it in half .... Come on, that’s two.” 
“All right. Here. And don’t swallow it.” 
“Do I look like an idiot?” 
[A short pause] “This is great, isn’t it?” 
“It sure is, Saumensch. ” 

At the end of August and summer, they found one pfennig on the 
ground. Pure excitement. 

It was sitting half rotten in some dirt, on the washing and ironing 
route. A solitary corroded coin. 

“Take a look at that!” 

Rudy swooped on it. The excitement almost stung as they rushed 
back to Frau Diller’s, not even considering that a single pfennig might 
not be the right price. They burst through the door and stood in front 
of the Aryan shopkeeper, who regarded them with contempt. 

“Pm waiting,” she said. Her hair was tied back and her black dress 
choked her body. The framed photo of the Führer kept watch from the 
wall. 

“Heil Hitler,” Rudy led. 

“Heil Hitler,” she responded, straightening taller behind the 
counter. “And you?” She glared at Liesel, who promptly gave her a 
“heil Hitler” of her own. 

It didn’t take Rudy long to dig the coin from his pocket and place it 
firmly on the counter. He looked straight into Frau Diller’s spectacled 
eyes and said, “Mixed candy, please.” 

Frau Diller smiled. Her teeth elbowed each other for room in her 
mouth, and her unexpected kindness made Rudy and Liesel smile as 
well. Not for long. 

She bent down, did some searching, and came back. “Here,” she 
said, tossing a single piece of candy onto the counter. “Mix it 
yourself.” 

Outside, they unwrapped it and tried biting it in half, but the sugar 
was like glass. Far too tough, even for Rudy’s animal-like choppers. 
Instead, they had to trade sucks on it until it was finished. Ten sucks 
for Rudy. Ten for Liesel. Back and forth. 

“This,” Rudy announced at one point, with a candy-toothed grin, 
“is the good life,” and Liesel didn’t disagree. By the time they were 
finished, both their mouths were an exaggerated red, and as they 
walked home, they reminded each other to keep their eyes peeled, in 
case they found another coin. 

Naturally, they found nothing. No one can be that lucky twice in 
one year, let alone a single afternoon. 
Still, with red tongues and teeth, they walked down Himmel Street, 
happily searching the ground as they went. 
The day had been a great one, and Nazi Germany was a wondrous 
place. 

THE STRUGGLER, CONTINUED 

We move forward now, to a cold night struggle. We’ll let the book 
thief catch up later. 

It was November 3, and the floor of the train held on to his feet. In 
front of him, he read from the copy of Mein Kampf. His savior. Sweat 
was swimming out of his hands. Fingermarks clutched the book.

OFFICIALLY PRESENTS 
Mein Kampf 

(My Struggle) 
by 
Adolf Hitler 

Behind Max Vandenburg, the city of Stuttgart opened its arms in 
mockery. 

He was not welcome there, and he tried not to look back as the 
stale bread disintegrated in his stomach. A few times, he shifted again 
and watched the lights become only a handful and then disappear 
altogether. 

Look proud, he advised himself. You cannot look afraid. Read the 
book. Smile at it. It’s a great book—the greatest book you’ve ever 
read. Ignore that woman on the other side. She’s asleep now anyway. 
Come on, Max, you’re only a few hours away. 

As it had turned out, the promised return visit in the room of 
darkness didn’t take days; it had taken a week and a half. Then 
another week till the next, and another, until he lost all sense of the 
passing of days and hours. He was relocated once more, to another 
small storage room, where there was more light, more visits, and 
more food. Time, however, was running out. 

“Tm leaving soon,” his friend Walter Kugler told him. “You know 
how it is—the army.” 

“Pm sorry, Walter.” 

Walter Kugler, Max’s friend from childhood, placed his hand on the 
Jew’s shoulder. “It could be worse.” He looked his friend in his 
Jewish eyes. “I could be you.” 
That was their last meeting. A final package was left in the corner, 
and this time, there was a ticket. Walter opened Mein Kampf and slid 
it inside, next to the map he’d brought with the book itself. “Page 
thirteen.” He smiled. “For luck, yes?” 

“For luck,” and the two of them embraced. 

When the door shut, Max opened the book and examined the ticket. 
Stuttgart to Munich to Pasing. It left in two days, in the night, just in 
time to make the last connection. From there, he would walk. The 
map was already in his head, folded in quarters. The key was still 
taped to the inside cover. 

He sat for half an hour before stepping toward the bag and opening it. 
Apart from food, a few other items sat inside. 

s e ¢ THE EXTRACONTENTS OF « « « 
WALTER KUGLER’S GIFT 
One small razor. 
A spoon—the closest thing to a mirror. 
Shaving cream. 

A pair of scissors. 

When he left it, the storeroom was empty but for the floor. 
“Goodbye,” he whispered. 

The last thing Max saw was the small mound of hair, sitting 
casually against the wall. 

Goodbye. 

With a clean-shaven face and lopsided yet neatly combed hair, he had 
walked out of that building a new man. In fact, he walked out 
German. Hang on a second, he was German. Or more to the point, he 
had been. 

In his stomach was the electric combination of nourishment and 
nausea. 

He walked to the station. 

He showed his ticket and identity card, and now he sat in a small 
box compartment of the train, directly in danger’s spotlight. 

“Papers.” 

That was what he dreaded to hear. 

It was bad enough when he was stopped on the platform. He knew 
he could not withstand it twice. 

The shivering hands. 
The smell—no, the stench—of guilt. 
He simply couldn’t bear it again. 

Fortunately, they came through early and only asked for the ticket, 
and now all that was left was a window of small towns, the 
congregations of lights, and the woman snoring on the other side of 
the compartment. 

For most of the journey, he made his way through the book, trying 
never to look up. 

The words lolled about in his mouth as he read them. 

Strangely, as he turned the pages and progressed through the 
chapters, it was only two words he ever tasted. 

Mein Kampf. My struggle— 

The title, over and over again, as the train prattled on, from one 
German town to the next. 

Mein Kampf. 
Of all the things to save him. 

TRICKSTERS 

You could argue that Liesel Meminger had it easy. She did have it 
easy compared to Max Vandenburg. Certainly, her brother practically 
died in her arms. Her mother abandoned her. 

But anything was better than being a Jew. 

In the time leading up to Max’s arrival, another washing customer 
was lost, this time the Weingartners. The obligatory Schimpferei 
occurred in the kitchen, and Liesel composed herself with the fact 
that there were still two left, and even better, one of them was the 
mayor, the wife, the books. 

As for Liesel’s other activities, she was still causing havoc with 
Rudy Steiner. I would even suggest that they were polishing their 
wicked ways. 

They made a few more journeys with Arthur Berg and his friends, 
keen to prove their worth and extend their thieving repertoire. They 
took potatoes from one farm, onions from another. Their biggest 
victory, however, they performed alone. 

As witnessed earlier, one of the benefits of walking through town 
was the prospect of finding things on the ground. Another was 
noticing people, or more important, the same people, doing identical 
things week after week. 

A boy from school, Otto Sturm, was one such person. Every Friday 
afternoon, he rode his bike to church, carrying goods to the priests. 

For a month, they watched him, as good weather turned to bad, 
and Rudy in particular was determined that one Friday, in an 
abnormally frosty week in October, Otto wouldn’t quite make it. 

“All those priests,” Rudy explained as they walked through town. 
“They’re all too fat anyway. They could do without a feed for a week 
or so.” Liesel could only agree. First of all, she wasn’t Catholic. 
Second, she was pretty hungry herself. As always, she was carrying 
the washing. Rudy was carrying two buckets of cold water, or as he 
put it, two buckets of future ice. 
Just before two o’clock, he went to work. 

Without any hesitation, he poured the water onto the road in the 
exact position where Otto would pedal around the corner. 

Liesel had to admit it. 

There was a small portion of guilt at first, but the plan was perfect, 
or at least as close to perfect as it could be. At just after two o’clock 
every Friday, Otto Sturm turned onto Munich Street with the produce 
in his front basket, at the handlebars. On this particular Friday, that 
was as far as he would travel. 

The road was icy as it was, but Rudy put on the extra coat, barely 
able to contain a grin. It ran across his face like a skid. 

“Come on,” he said, “that bush there.” 

After approximately fifteen minutes, the diabolical plan bore its fruit, 
so to speak. 

Rudy pointed his finger into a gap in the bush. “There he is.” 
Otto came around the corner, dopey as a lamb. 

He wasted no time in losing control of the bike, sliding across the 
ice, and lying facedown on the road. 

When he didn’t move, Rudy looked at Liesel with alarm. “Crucified 
Christ,” he said, “I think we might have killed him!” He crept slowly 
out, removed the basket, and they made their getaway. 

“Was he breathing?” Liesel asked, farther down the street. 
“Keine Ahnung,” Rudy said, clinging to the basket. He had no idea. 
From far down the hill, they watched as Otto stood up, scratched 

his head, scratched his crotch, and looked everywhere for the basket. 

“Stupid Scheisskopf.” Rudy grinned, and they looked through the 
spoils. Bread, broken eggs, and the big one, Speck. Rudy held the fatty 
ham to his nose and breathed it gloriously in. “Beautiful.” 

As tempting as it was to keep the victory to themselves, they were 
overpowered by a sense of loyalty to Arthur Berg. They made their 
way to his impoverished lodging on Kempf Strasse and showed him 
the produce. Arthur couldn’t hold back his approval. 

“Who did you steal this from?” 
It was Rudy who answered. “Otto Sturm.” 

“Well,” he nodded, “whoever that is, I’m grateful to him.” He 
walked inside and returned with a bread knife, a frying pan, and a 
jacket, and the three thieves walked the hallway of apartments. “We’ll 
get the others,” Arthur Berg stated as they made it outside. “We might 
be criminals, but we’re not totally immoral.” Much like the book 
thief, he at least drew the line somewhere. 

A few more doors were knocked on. Names were called out to 
apartments from streets below, and soon, the whole conglomerate of 
Arthur Berg’s fruit-stealing troop was on its way to the Amper. In the 
clearing on the other side, a fire was lit and what was left of the eggs 
was salvaged and fried. The bread and Speck were cut. With hands 
and knives, every last piece of Otto Sturm’s delivery was eaten. No 
priest in sight. 

It was only at the end that an argument developed, regarding the 
basket. The majority of boys wanted to burn it. Fritz Hammer and 
Andy Schmeikl wanted to keep it, but Arthur Berg, showing his 
incongruous moral aptitude, had a better idea. 

“You two,” he said to Rudy and Liesel. “Maybe you should take it 
back to that Sturm character. Pd say that poor bastard probably 
deserves that much.” 

“Oh, come on, Arthur.” 

“T don’t want to hear it, Andy.” 
“Jesus Christ.” 
“He doesn’t want to hear it, either.” 
The group laughed and Rudy Steiner picked up the basket. “Pll take 
it back and hang it on their mailbox.” 

He had walked only twenty meters or so when the girl caught up. 
She would be home far too late for comfort, but she was well aware 
that she had to accompany Rudy Steiner through town, to the Sturm 
farm on the other side. 

For a long time, they walked in silence. 
“Do you feel bad?” Liesel finally asked. They were already on the 
way home. 
“About what?” 
“You know.” 
“Of course I do, but Pm not hungry anymore, and I bet he’s not 
hungry, either. Don’t think for a second that the priests would get 
food if there wasn’t enough to go around at home.” 
“He just hit the ground so hard.” 
“Don’t remind me.” But Rudy Steiner couldn’t resist smiling. In 
years to come, he would be a giver of bread, not a stealer—proof 

again of the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. 
Just add water. 

Five days after their bittersweet little victory, Arthur Berg emerged 
again and invited them on his next stealing project. They ran into him 
on Munich Street, on the way home from school on a Wednesday. He 
was already in his Hitler Youth uniform. “We’re going again 
tomorrow afternoon. You interested?” 

They couldn’t help themselves. “Where?” 
“The potato place.” 

Twenty-four hours later, Liesel and Rudy braved the wire fence again 
and filled their sack. 
The problem showed up as they made their getaway. 
“Christ!” shouted Arthur. “The farmer!” It was his next word, 
however, that frightened. He called it out as if he’d already been 
attacked with it. His mouth ripped open. The word flew out, and the 
word was ax. 

Sure enough, when they turned around, the farmer was running at 
them, the weapon held aloft. 

The whole group ran for the fence line and made their way over. 
Rudy, who was farthest away, caught up quickly, but not quickly 
enough to avoid being last. As he pulled his leg up, he became 
entangled. 

“Hey!” 
The sound of the stranded. 

The group stopped. 
Instinctively, Liesel ran back. 

“Hurry up!” Arthur called out. His voice was far away, as if he’d 
swallowed it before it exited his mouth. 

White sky. 
The others ran. 
Liesel arrived and started pulling at the fabric of his pants. Rudy’s 
eyes were opened wide with fear. “Quick,” he said, “he’s coming.” 

Far off, they could still hear the sound of deserting feet when an 
extra hand grabbed the wire and reefed it away from Rudy Steiner’s 
pants. A piece was left on the metallic knot, but the boy was able to 
escape. 

“Now move it,” Arthur advised them, not long before the farmer 
arrived, swearing and struggling for breath. The ax held on now, with 

force, to his leg. He called out the futile words of the robbed: 
“Pll have you arrested! Pl find you! Pl find out who you are!” 
That was when Arthur Berg replied. 

“The name is Owens!” He loped away, catching up to Liesel and 
Rudy. “Jesse Owens!” 

When they made it to safe ground, fighting to suck the air into their 
lungs, they sat down and Arthur Berg came over. Rudy wouldn’t look 
at him. “It’s happened to all of us,” Arthur said, sensing the 
disappointment. Was he lying? They couldn’t be sure and they would 
never find out. 

A few weeks later, Arthur Berg moved to Cologne. 

They saw him once more, on one of Liesel’s washing delivery 
rounds. In an alleyway off Munich Street, he handed Liesel a brown 
paper bag containing a dozen chestnuts. He smirked. “A contact in 
the roasting industry.” After informing them of his departure, he 
managed to proffer a last pimply smile and to cuff each of them on 
the forehead. “Don’t go eating all those things at once, either,” and 
they never saw Arthur Berg again. 

As for me, I can tell you that I most definitely saw him. 

e e e A SMALL TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR BERG, « « « 
A STILL-LIVING MAN 
The Cologne sky was yellow and rotting, flaking at the edges. 
He sat propped against a wall with a child in his arms. His 
sister. 
When she stopped breathing, he stayed with her, and I could 
sense he would hold her for hours. 
There were two stolen apples in his pocket. 

This time, they played it smarter. They ate one chestnut each and sold 
the rest of them door to door. 

“If you have a few pfennig to spare,” Liesel said at each house, “I 
have chestnuts.” They ended up with sixteen coins. 

“Now,” Rudy grinned, “revenge.” 

That same afternoon, they returned to Frau Diller’s, “heil Hitlered,” 
and waited. 

“Mixed candy again?” She schmunzeled, to which they nodded. The 
money splashed the counter and Frau Diller’s smile fell slightly ajar. 

“Yes, Frau Diller,” they said in unison. “Mixed candy, please.” 
The framed Fuhrer looked proud of them. 
Triumph before the storm. 

THE STRUGGLER, CONCLUDED 

The juggling comes to an end now, but the struggling does not. I have 
Liesel Meminger in one hand, Max Vandenburg in the other. Soon, I 
will clap them together. Just give me a few pages. 

The struggler: 
If they killed him tonight, at least he would die alive. 

The train ride was far away now, the snorer most likely tucked up 
in the carriage she’d made her bed, traveling on. Now there were only 
footsteps between Max and survival. Footsteps and thoughts, and 
doubts. 

He followed the map in his mind, from Pasing to Molching. It was 
late when he saw the town. His legs ached terribly, but he was nearly 
there—the most dangerous place to be. Close enough to touch it. 

Just as it was described, he found Munich Street and made his way 
along the footpath. 

Everything stiffened. 

Glowing pockets of streetlights. 
Dark, passive buildings. 

The town hall stood like a giant ham-fisted youth, too big for his 
age. The church disappeared in darkness the farther his eyes traveled 
upward. 

It all watched him. 
He shivered. 
He warned himself. “Keep your eyes open.” 

(German children were on the lookout for stray coins. German Jews 
kept watch for possible capture.) 

In keeping with the usage of number thirteen for luck, he counted 
his footsteps in groups of that number. Just thirteen footsteps, he 
would tell himself. Come on, just thirteen more. As an estimate, he 
completed ninety sets, till at last, he stood on the corner of Himmel 
Street. 

In one hand, he held his suitcase. 
The other was still holding Mein Kampf. 
Both were heavy, and both were handled with a gentle secretion of 
sweat. 

Now he turned on to the side street, making his way to number 
thirty-three, resisting the urge to smile, resisting the urge to sob or 
even imagine the safety that might be awaiting him. He reminded 
himself that this was no time for hope. Certainly, he could almost 
touch it. He could feel it, somewhere just out of reach. Instead of 
acknowledging it, he went about the business of deciding again what 
to do if he was caught at the last moment or if by some chance the 
wrong person awaited him inside. 

Of course, there was also the scratchy feeling of sin. 
How could he do this? 

How could he show up and ask people to risk their lives for him? 
How could he be so selfish? 

Thirty-three. 
They looked at each other. 

The house was pale, almost sick-looking, with an iron gate and a 
brown spit-stained door. 

From his pocket, he pulled out the key. It did not sparkle but lay 
dull and limp in his hand. For a moment, he squeezed it, half 
expecting it to come leaking toward his wrist. It didn’t. The metal was 
hard and flat, with a healthy set of teeth, and he squeezed it till it 
pierced him. 

Slowly, then, the struggler leaned forward, his cheek against the 
wood, and he removed the key from his fist.

THE ACCORDIONIST 
(The Secret Life of Hans Hubermann) 

There was a young man standing in the kitchen. The key in his hand 
felt like it was rusting into his palm. He didn’t speak anything like 
hello, or please help, or any other such expected sentence. He asked 
two questions. 

» © + QUESTION ONE = « + 
“Hans Hubermann?” 

. + e QUESTION TWO = « « 
“Do you still play the accordion?” 

As he looked uncomfortably at the human shape before him, the 
young man’s voice was scraped out and handed across the dark like it 
was all that remained of him. 
Papa, alert and appalled, stepped closer. 
To the kitchen, he whispered, “Of course I do.” 
It all dated back many years, to World War I. 

They’re strange, those wars. 

Full of blood and violence—but also full of stories that are equally 
difficult to fathom. “It’s true,” people will mutter. “I don’t care if you 
don’t believe me. It was that fox who saved my life,” or, “They died 
on either side of me and I was left standing there, the only one 
without a bullet between my eyes. Why me? Why me and not them?” 

Hans Hubermann’s story was a little like that. When I found it 
within the book thief’s words, I realized that we passed each other 
once in a while during that period, though neither of us scheduled a 
meeting. Personally, I had a lot of work to do. As for Hans, I think he 
was doing his best to avoid me. 

The first time we were in the vicinity of each other, Hans was twenty- 
two years old, fighting in France. The majority of young men in his 
platoon were eager to fight. Hans wasn’t so sure. I had taken a few of 
them along the way, but you could say I never even came close to 
touching Hans Hubermann. He was either too lucky, or he deserved 
to live, or there was a good reason for him to live. 

In the army, he didn’t stick out at either end. He ran in the middle, 
climbed in the middle, and he could shoot straight enough so as not 
to affront his superiors. Nor did he excel enough to be one of the first 
chosen to run straight at me. 

e «© eA SMALL BUT NOTE WORTHY NOTE = « « 
I’ve seen so many young men over the years who think they’re 
running at other young men. 
They are not. 
They’re running at me. 

He’d been in the fight for almost six months when he ended up in 
France, where, at face value, a strange event saved his life. Another 
perspective would suggest that in the nonsense of war, it made 
perfect sense. 

On the whole, his time in the Great War had astonished him from the 
moment he entered the army. It was like a serial. Day after day after 
day. After day: 

The conversation of bullets. 

Resting men. 
The best dirty jokes in the world. 

Cold sweat—that malignant little friend—outstaying its welcome in 
the armpits and trousers. 

He enjoyed the card games the most, followed by the few games of 
chess, despite being thoroughly pathetic at it. And the music. Always 
the music. 

It was a man a year older than himself—a German Jew named Erik 
Vandenburg—who taught him to play the accordion. The two of them 
gradually became friends due to the fact that neither of them was 
terribly interested in fighting. They preferred rolling cigarettes to 
rolling in snow and mud. They preferred shooting craps to shooting 
bullets. A firm friendship was built on gambling, smoking, and music, 
not to mention a shared desire for survival. The only trouble with this 
was that Erik Vandenburg would later be found in several pieces on a 
grassy hill. His eyes were open and his wedding ring was stolen. I 
shoveled up his soul with the rest of them and we drifted away. The 
horizon was the color of milk. Cold and fresh. Poured out among the 
bodies. 

All that was really left of Erik Vandenburg was a few personal 
items and the fingerprinted accordion. Everything but the instrument 
was sent home. It was considered too big. Almost with self-reproach, 
it sat on his makeshift bed at the base camp and was given to his 
friend, Hans Hubermann, who happened to be the only man to 
survive. 

e e e HE SURVIVED LIKE THIS « « « 
He didn’t go into battle that day. 

For that, he had Erik Vandenburg to thank. Or more to the point, Erik 
Vandenburg and the sergeant’s toothbrush. 

That particular morning, not too long before they were leaving, 
Sergeant Stephan Schneider paced into the sleeping quarters and 
called everyone to attention. He was popular with the men for his 
sense of humor and practical jokes, but more so for the fact that he 
never followed anyone into the fire. He always went first. 

On certain days, he was inclined to enter the room of resting men 
and say something like, “Who comes from Pasing?” or, “Who’s good 
with mathematics?” or, in the fateful case of Hans Hubermann, 
“Who’s got neat handwriting?” 

No one ever volunteered, not after the first time he did it. On that 
day, an eager young soldier named Philipp Schlink stood proudly up 
and said, “Yes, sir, I come from Pasing.” He was promptly handed a 
toothbrush and told to clean the shit house. 

When the sergeant asked who had the best penmanship, you can 
surely understand why no one was keen to step forward. They 
thought they might be first to receive a full hygiene inspection or 
scrub an eccentric lieutenant’s shit-trampled boots before they left. 
“Now come on,” Schneider toyed with them. Slapped down with 
oil, his hair gleamed, though a small piece was always upright and 
vigilant at the apex of his head. “At least one of you useless bastards 
must be able to write properly.” 

In the distance, there was gunfire. 
It triggered a reaction. 

“Look,” said Schneider, “this isn’t like the others. It will take all 
morning, maybe longer.” He couldn’t resist a smile. “Schlink was 
polishing that shit house while the rest of you were playing cards, but 
this time, you’re going out there.” 

Life or pride. 

He was clearly hoping that one of his men would have the 
intelligence to take life. 

Erik Vandenburg and Hans Hubermann glanced at each other. If 
someone stepped forward now, the platoon would make his life a 
living hell for the rest of their time together. No one likes a coward. 
On the other hand, if someone was to be nominated ... 

Still no one stepped forward, but a voice stooped out and ambled 
toward the sergeant. It sat at his feet, waiting for a good kicking. It 
said, “Hubermann, sir.” The voice belonged to Erik Vandenburg. He 
obviously thought that today wasn’t the appropriate time for his 
friend to die. 

The sergeant paced up and down the passage of soldiers. 
“Who said that?” 

He was a superb pacer, Stephan Schneider—a small man who 
spoke, moved, and acted in a hurry. As he strode up and down the 
two lines, Hans looked on, waiting for the news. Perhaps one of the 
nurses was sick and they needed someone to strip and replace 
bandages on the infected limbs of injured soldiers. Perhaps a 
thousand envelopes were to be licked and sealed and sent home with 
death notices in them. 

At that moment, the voice was put forward again, moving a few 
others to make themselves heard. “Hubermann,” they echoed. Erik 
even said, “Immaculate handwriting, sir, immaculate.” 

“Its settled, then.” There was a circular, small-mouthed grin. 
“Hubermann. Youre it.” 

The gangly young soldier made his way forward and asked what his 
duty might be. 

The sergeant sighed. “The captain needs a few dozen letters written 
for him. He’s got terrible rheumatism in his fingers. Or arthritis. 
You'll be writing them for him.” 

This was no time to argue, especially when Schlink was sent to 
clean the toilets and the other one, Pflegger, nearly killed himself 
licking envelopes. His tongue was infection blue. 

“Yes, sir.” Hans nodded, and that was the end of it. His writing 
ability was dubious to say the least, but he considered himself lucky. 
He wrote the letters as best he could while the rest of the men went 
into battle. 

None of them came back. 

That was the first time Hans Hubermann escaped me. The Great War. 
A second escape was still to come, in 1943, in Essen. 
Two wars for two escapes. 
Once young, once middle-aged. 
Not many men are lucky enough to cheat me twice. 

He carried the accordion with him during the entirety of the war. 

When he tracked down the family of Erik Vandenburg in Stuttgart 
upon his return, Vandenburg’s wife informed him that he could keep 
it. Her apartment was littered with them, and it upset her too much 
to look at that one in particular. The others were reminder enough, as 
was her once-shared profession of teaching it. 

“He taught me to play,” Hans informed her, as though it might 
help. 

Perhaps it did, for the devastated woman asked if he could play it 
for her, and she silently wept as he pressed the buttons and keys of a 
clumsy “Blue Danube Waltz.” It was her husband’s favorite. 

“You know,” Hans explained to her, “he saved my life.” The light in 
the room was small, and the air restrained. “He—if there’s anything 
you ever need.” He slid a piece of paper with his name and address 
on it across the table. “I’m a painter by trade. I'll paint your 
apartment for free, whenever you like.” He knew it was useless 
compensation, but he offered anyway. 

The woman took the paper, and not long after, a small child 
wandered in and sat on her lap. 

“This is Max,” the woman said, but the boy was too young and shy 
to say anything. He was skinny, with soft hair, and his thick, murky 
eyes watched as the stranger played one more song in the heavy 
room. From face to face, he looked on as the man played and the 
woman wept. The different notes handled her eyes. Such sadness. 

Hans left. 

“You never told me,” he said to a dead Erik Vandenburg and the 
Stuttgart skyline. “You never told me you had a son.” 

After a momentary, head-shaken stoppage, Hans returned to 
Munich, expecting never to hear from those people again. What he 
didn’t know was that his help would most definitely be needed, but 
not for painting, and not for another twenty years or so. 

There were a few weeks before he started painting. In the good- 
weather months, he worked vigorously, and even in winter, he often 
said to Rosa that business might not be pouring, but it would at least 
drizzle now and again. 

For more than a decade, it all worked. 

Hans Junior and Trudy were born. They grew up making visits to 
their papa at work, slapping paint on walls and cleaning brushes. 

When Hitler rose to power in 1933, though, the painting business 
fell slightly awry. Hans didn’t join the NSDAP like the majority of 
people did. He put a lot of thought into his decision. 

e e e THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF « « « 
HANS HUBERMANN 
He was not well-educated or political, but if nothing else, he 
was a man who appreciated fairness. A Jew had once saved his 
life and he couldn’t forget that. He couldn’t join a party that 
antagonized people in such a way. 
Also, much like Alex Steiner, some of his most loyal customers 

were Jewish. Like many of the Jews believed, he didn’t think the 
hatred could last, and it was a conscious decision not to follow 
Hitler. On many levels, it was a disastrous one. 

Once the persecution began, his work slowly dried up. It wasn’t too 
bad to begin with, but soon enough, he was losing customers. 
Handfuls of quotes seemed to vanish into the rising Nazi air. 

He approached an old faithful named Herbert Bollinger—a man 
with a hemispheric waistline who spoke Hochdeutsch (he was from 
Hamburg)—when he saw him on Munich Street. At first, the man 
looked down, past his girth, to the ground, but when his eyes 
returned to the painter, the question clearly made him uncomfortable. 
There was no reason for Hans to ask, but he did. 

“What’s going on, Herbert? Pm losing customers quicker than I can 
count.” 

Bollinger didn’t flinch anymore. Standing upright, he delivered the 
fact as a question of his own. “Well, Hans. Are you a member?” 

“Of what?” 

But Hans Hubermann knew exactly what the man was talking 
about. 

“Come on, Hansi,” Bollinger persisted. “Don’t make me spell it out.” 
The tall painter waved him away and walked on. 

As the years passed by, the Jews were being terrorized at random 
throughout the country, and in the spring of 1937, almost to his 
shame, Hans Hubermann finally submitted. He made some inquiries 
and applied to join the Party. 

After lodging his form at the Nazi headquarters on Munich Street, 
he witnessed four men throw several bricks into a clothing store 
named Kleinmann’s. It was one of the few Jewish shops that were still 
in operation in Molching. Inside, a small man was stuttering about, 
crushing the broken glass beneath his feet as he cleaned up. A star the 

color of mustard was smeared to the door. In sloppy lettering, the 
words JEWISH FILTH were spilling over at their edges. The 
movement inside tapered from hurried to morose, then stopped 
altogether. 
Hans moved closer and stuck his head inside. “Do you need some 
help?” 
Mr. Kleinmann looked up. A dust broom was fixed powerlessly to 
his hand. “No, Hans. Please. Go away.” Hans had painted Joel 
Kleinmann’s house the previous year. He remembered his three 
children. He could see their faces but couldn’t recall their names. 

“T will come tomorrow,” he said, “and repaint your door.” 
Which he did. 
It was the second of two mistakes. 

The first occurred immediately after the incident. 

He returned to where he’d come from and drove his fist onto the 
door and then the window of the NSDAP. The glass shuddered but no 
one replied. Everyone had packed up and gone home. A last member 
was walking in the opposite direction. When he heard the rattle of the 
glass, he noticed the painter. 
He came back and asked what was wrong. 
“T can no longer join,” Hans stated. 
The man was shocked. “Why not?” 

Hans looked at the knuckles of his right hand and swallowed. He 
could already taste the error, like a metal tablet in his mouth. “Forget 
it.” He turned and walked home. 

Words followed him. 

“You just think about it, Herr Hubermann. Let us know what you 
decide.” 

He did not acknowledge them. 

The following morning, as promised, he rose earlier than usual, but 
not early enough. The door at Kleinmann’s Clothing was still moist 
with dew. Hans dried it. He managed to match the color as close as 
humanly possible and gave it a good solid coat. 

Innocuously, a man walked past. 
“Heil Hitler,” he said. 
“Heil Hitler,” Hans replied. 

e e ¢ THREE SMALL BUT « « « 
IMPORTANT FACTS 
1. The man who walked past was Rolf Fischer, one of Molching’s 
greatest Nazis. 
2. A new slur was painted on the door within sixteen hours. 
3. Hans Hubermann was not granted membership in the Nazi 

Party. Not yet, anyway. 

For the next year, Hans was lucky that he didn’t revoke his 
membership application officially. While many people were instantly 
approved, he was added to a waiting list, regarded with suspicion. 
Toward the end of 1938, when the Jews were cleared out completely 
after Kristallnacht, the Gestapo visited. They searched the house, and 
when nothing or no one suspicious was found, Hans Hubermann was 
one of the fortunate: 

He was allowed to stay. 

What probably saved him was that people knew he was at least 
waiting for his application to be approved. For this, he was tolerated, 
if not endorsed as the competent painter he was. 

Then there was his other savior. 

It was the accordion that most likely spared him from total 
ostracism. Painters there were, from all over Munich, but under the 
brief tutorage of Erik Vandenburg and nearly two decades of his own 

steady practice, there was no one in Molching who could play exactly 
like him. It was a style not of perfection, but warmth. Even mistakes 
had a good feeling about them. 

He “heil Hitlered” when it was asked of him and he flew the flag on 
the right days. There was no apparent problem. 

Then, on June 16, 1939 (the date was like cement now), just over 
six months after Liesel’s arrival on Himmel Street, an event occurred 
that altered the life of Hans Hubermann irreversibly. 

It was a day in which he had some work. 
He left the house at 7 a.m. sharp. 

He towed his paint cart behind him, oblivious to the fact that he 
was being followed. 

When he arrived at the work site, a young stranger walked up to 
him. He was blond and tall, and serious. 

The pair watched each other. 
“Would you be Hans Hubermann?” 
Hans gave him a single nod. He was reaching for a paintbrush. 
“Yes, I would.” 
“Do you play the accordion, by any chance?” 

This time, Hans stopped, leaving the brush where it was. Again, he 
nodded. 

The stranger rubbed his jaw, looked around him, and then spoke 
with great quietness, yet great clarity. “Are you a man who likes to 
keep a promise?” 
Hans took out two paint cans and invited him to sit down. Before 
he accepted the invitation, the young man extended his hand and 
introduced himself. “My name’s Kugler. Walter. I come from 
Stuttgart.” 

They sat and talked quietly for fifteen minutes or so, arranging a 
meeting for later on, in the night. 

A GOOD GIRL 

In November 1940, when Max Vandenburg arrived in the kitchen of 
33 Himmel Street, he was twenty-four years old. His clothes seemed 
to weigh him down, and his tiredness was such that an itch could 
break him in two. He stood shaking and shaken in the doorway. 
“Do you still play the accordion?” 

Of course, the question was really, “Will you still help me?” 

Liesel’s papa walked to the front door and opened it. Cautiously, he 
looked outside, each way, and returned. The verdict was “nothing.” 
Max Vandenburg, the Jew, closed his eyes and drooped a little 
further into safety. The very idea of it was ludicrous, but he accepted 
it nonetheless. 
Hans checked that the curtains were properly closed. Not a crack 
could be showing. As he did so, Max could no longer bear it. He 
crouched down and clasped his hands. 
The darkness stroked him. 
His fingers smelled of suitcase, metal, Mein Kampf, and survival. 
It was only when he lifted his head that the dim light from the 
hallway reached his eyes. He noticed the pajamaed girl, standing 
there, in full view. 
“Papa?” 
Max stood up, like a struck match. The darkness swelled now, 
around him. 
“Everything’s fine, Liesel,” Papa said. “Go back to bed.” 
She lingered a moment before her feet dragged from behind. When 
she stopped and stole one last look at the foreigner in the kitchen, she 
could decipher the outline of a book on the table. 

“Don’t be afraid,” she heard Papa whisper. “She’s a good girl.” 

For the next hour, the good girl lay wide awake in bed, listening to 
the quiet fumbling of sentences in the kitchen. 

One wild card was yet to be played. 

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE JEWISH FIST FIGHTER 

Max Vandenburg was born in 1916. 
He grew up in Stuttgart. 

When he was younger, he grew to love nothing more than a good 
fistfight. 

He had his first bout when he was eleven years old and skinny as a 
whittled broom handle. 

Wenzel Gruber. 
That’s who he fought. 

He had a smart mouth, that Gruber kid, and wire-curly hair. The 
local playground demanded that they fight, and neither boy was 
about to argue. 

They fought like champions. 
For a minute. 

Just when it was getting interesting, both boys were hauled away 
by their collars. A watchful parent. 

A trickle of blood was dripping from Max’s mouth. 
He tasted it, and it tasted good. 

Not many people who came from his neighborhood were fighters, and 
if they were, they didn’t do it with their fists. In those days, they said 
the Jews preferred to simply stand and take things. Take the abuse 
quietly and then work their way back to the top. Obviously, every 
Jew is not the same. 

He was nearly two years old when his father died, shot to pieces on a 
grassy hill. 

When he was nine, his mother was completely broke. She sold the 
music studio that doubled as their apartment and they moved to his 
uncle’s house. There he grew up with six cousins who battered, 
annoyed, and loved him. Fighting with the oldest one, Isaac, was the 
training ground for his fist fighting. He was trounced almost every 
night. 

At thirteen, tragedy struck again when his uncle died. 

As percentages would suggest, his uncle was not a hothead like 
Max. He was the type of person who worked quietly away for very 
little reward. He kept to himself and sacrificed everything for his 
family—and he died of something growing in his stomach. Something 
akin to a poison bowling ball. 
As is often the case, the family surrounded the bed and watched 
him capitulate. 

Somehow, between the sadness and loss, Max Vandenburg, who 
was now a teenager with hard hands, blackened eyes, and a sore 
tooth, was also a little disappointed. Even disgruntled. As he watched 
his uncle sink slowly into the bed, he decided that he would never 
allow himself to die like that. 
The man’s face was so accepting. 
So yellow and tranquil, despite the violent architecture of his skull 
—the endless jawline, stretching for miles; the pop-up cheek-bones; 
and the pothole eyes. So calm it made the boy want to ask something. 

Where’s the fight? he wondered. 
Where’s the will to hold on? 

Of course, at thirteen, he was a little excessive in his harshness. He 
had not looked something like me in the face. Not yet. 

With the rest of them, he stood around the bed and watched the 

man die—a safe merge, from life to death. The light in the window 
was gray and orange, the color of summer’s skin, and his uncle 
appeared relieved when his breathing disappeared completely. 

“When death captures me,” the boy vowed, “he will feel my fist on 
his face.” 

Personally, I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry. 
Yes. 
I like that a lot. 

From that moment on, he started to fight with greater regularity. A 
group of die-hard friends and enemies would gather down at a small 
reserve on Steber Street, and they would fight in the dying light. 
Archetypal Germans, the odd Jew, the boys from the east. It didn’t 
matter. There was nothing like a good fight to expel the teenage 
energy. Even the enemies were an inch away from friendship. 

He enjoyed the tight circles and the unknown. 
The bittersweetness of uncertainty: 
To win or to lose. 

It was a feeling in the stomach that would be stirred around until 
he thought he could no longer tolerate it. The only remedy was to 
move forward and throw punches. Max was not the type of boy to die 
thinking about it. 

His favorite fight, now that he looked back, was Fight Number Five 
against a tall, tough, rangy kid named Walter Kugler. They were 
fifteen. Walter had won all four of their previous encounters, but this 
time, Max could feel something different. There was new blood in 
him—the blood of victory—and it had the capability to both frighten 
and excite. 

As always, there was a tight circle crowded around them. There 
was grubby ground. There were smiles practically wrapped around 
the onlooking faces. Money was clutched in filthy fingers, and the 
calls and cries were filled with such vitality that there was nothing 
else but this. 

God, there was such joy and fear there, such brilliant commotion. 

The two fighters were clenched with the intensity of the moment, 
their faces loaded up with expression, exaggerated with the stress of 
it. The wide-eyed concentration. 

After a minute or so of testing each other out, they began moving 
closer and taking more risks. It was a street fight after all, not an 
hour-long title fight. They didn’t have all day. 

“Come on, Max!” one of his friends was calling out. There was no 
breath between any of the words. “Come on, Maxi Taxi, you’ve got 
him now, you’ve got him, Jew boy, you’ve got him, you’ve got him!” 
A small kid with soft tufts of hair, a beaten nose, and swampy eyes, 
Max was a good head shorter than his opposition. His fighting style 
was utterly graceless, all bent over, nudging forward, throwing fast 
punches at the face of Kugler. The other boy, clearly stronger and 
more skillful, remained upright, throwing jabs that constantly landed 
on Max’s cheeks and chin. 

Max kept coming. 

Even with the heavy absorption of punches and punishment, he 
continued moving forward. Blood discolored his lips. It would soon be 
dried across his teeth. 

There was a great roar when he was knocked down. Money was 
almost exchanged. 

Max stood up. 

He was beaten down one more time before he changed tactics, 
luring Walter Kugler a little closer than he’d wanted to come. Once he 
was there, Max was able to apply a short, sharp jab to his face. It 
stuck. Exactly on the nose. 

Kugler, suddenly blinded, shuffled back, and Max seized his chance. 
He followed him over to the right and jabbed him once more and 
opened him up with a punch that reached into his ribs. The right 
hand that ended him landed on his chin. Walter Kugler was on the 
ground, his blond hair peppered with dirt. His legs were parted in a 
V. Tears like crystal floated down his skin, despite the fact that he 
was not crying. The tears had been bashed out of him. 

The circle counted. 
They always counted, just in case. Voices and numbers. 

The custom after a fight was that the loser would raise the hand of 
the victor. When Kugler finally stood up, he walked sullenly to Max 
Vandenburg and lifted his arm into the air. 

“Thanks,” Max told him. 
Kugler proffered a warning. “Next time I kill you.” 

Altogether, over the next few years, Max Vandenburg and Walter 
Kugler fought thirteen times. Walter was always seeking revenge for 
that first victory Max took from him, and Max was looking to emulate 
his moment of glory. In the end, the record stood at 10-3 for Walter. 

They fought each other until 1933, when they were seventeen. 
Grudging respect turned to genuine friendship, and the urge to fight 
left them. Both held jobs until Max was sacked with the rest of the 
Jews at the Jedermann Engineering Factory in ‘35. That wasn’t long 
after the Nuremberg Laws came in, forbidding Jews to have German 
citizenship and for Germans and Jews to intermarry. 

“Jesus,” Walter said one evening, when they met on the small 
corner where they used to fight. “That was a time, wasn’t it? There 
was none of this around.” He gave the star on Max’s sleeve a 
backhanded slap. “We could never fight like that now.” 

Max disagreed. “Yes we could. You can’t marry a Jew, but there’s 
no law against fighting one.” 

Walter smiled. “There’s probably a law rewarding it—as long as you 
win.” 

For the next few years, they saw each other sporadically at best. Max, 
with the rest of the Jews, was steadily rejected and repeatedly 
trodden upon, while Walter disappeared inside his job. A printing 
firm. 

If you’re the type who’s interested, yes, there were a few girls in 
those years. One named Tania, the other Hildi. Neither of them 
lasted. There was no time, most likely due to the uncertainty and 
mounting pressure. Max needed to scavenge for work. What could he 
offer those girls? By 1938, it was difficult to imagine that life could 
get any harder. 

Then came November 9. Kristallnacht. The night of broken glass. 

It was the very incident that destroyed so many of his fellow Jews, 
but it proved to be Max Vandenburg’s moment of escape. He was 
twenty-two. 

Many Jewish establishments were being surgically smashed and 
looted when there was a clatter of knuckles on the apartment door. 
With his aunt, his mother, his cousins, and their children, Max was 
crammed into the living room. 

“Aufmachen!” 

The family watched each other. There was a great temptation to 
scatter into the other rooms, but apprehension is the strangest thing. 
They couldn’t move. 
Again. “Open up!” 
Isaac stood and walked to the door. The wood was alive, still 
humming from the beating it had just been given. He looked back at 
the faces naked with fear, turned the lock, and opened the door. 

As expected, it was a Nazi. In uniform. 

“Never.” 
That was Max’s first response. 

He clung to his mother’s hand and that of Sarah, the nearest of his 
cousins. “I won’t leave. If we all can’t go, I don’t go, either.” 
He was lying. 
When he was pushed out by the rest of his family, the relief 
struggled inside him like an obscenity. It was something he didn’t 
want to feel, but nonetheless, he felt it with such gusto it made him 
want to throw up. How could he? How could he? 

But he did. 

“Bring nothing,” Walter told him. “Just what you’re wearing. I'll 
give you the rest.” 

“Max.” It was his mother. 

From a drawer, she took an old piece of paper and stuffed it in his 
jacket pocket. “If ever ...” She held him one last time, by the elbows. 
“This could be your last hope.” 

He looked into her aging face and kissed her, very hard, on the lips. 

“Come on.” Walter pulled at him as the rest of the family said their 
goodbyes and gave him money and a few valuables. “It’s chaos out 
there, and chaos is what we need.” 

They left, without looking back. 
It tortured him. 

If only he’d turned for one last look at his family as he left the 
apartment. Perhaps then the guilt would not have been so heavy. No 
final goodbye. 

No final grip of the eyes. 
Nothing but goneness. 

For the next two years, he remained in hiding, in an empty 

storeroom. It was in a building where Walter had worked in previous 
years. There was very little food. There was plenty of suspicion. The 
remaining Jews with money in the neighborhood were emigrating. 
The Jews without money were also trying, but without much success. 
Max’s family fell into the latter category. Walter checked on them 
occasionally, as inconspicuously as he could. One afternoon, when he 
visited, someone else opened the door. 

When Max heard the news, his body felt like it was being screwed 
up into a ball, like a page littered with mistakes. Like garbage. 

Yet each day, he managed to unravel and straighten himself, 
disgusted and thankful. Wrecked, but somehow not torn into pieces. 

Halfway through 1939, just over six months into the period of hiding, 
they decided that a new course of action needed to be taken. They 
examined the piece of paper Max was handed upon his desertion. 
That’s right—his desertion, not only his escape. That was how he 
viewed it, amid the grotesquerie of his relief. We already know what 
was written on that piece of paper: 

e e © ONE NAME, ONE ADDRESS « « ù 
Hans Hubermann 
Himmel Street 33, Molching 

“It’s getting worse,” Walter told Max. “Anytime now, they could find 
us out.” There was much hunching in the dark. “We don’t know what 
might happen. I might get caught. You might need to find that place 
.... ’m too scared to ask anyone for help here. They might put me in.” 
There was only one solution. “Pl go down there and find this man. If 
he’s turned into a Nazi—which is very likely—ľl1I just turn around. At 
least we know then, richtig?” 

Max gave him every last pfennig to make the trip, and a few days 

later, when Walter returned, they embraced before he held his breath. 
“And?” 

Walter nodded. “He’s good. He still plays that accordion your 
mother told you about—your father’s. He’s not a member of the 
party. He gave me money.” At this stage, Hans Hubermann was only 
a list. “He’s fairly poor, he’s married, and there’s a kid.” 

This sparked Max’s attention even further. “How old?” 
“Ten. You can’t have everything.” 
“Yes. Kids have big mouths.” 
“We’re lucky as it is.” 
They sat in silence awhile. It was Max who disturbed it. 
“He must already hate me, huh?” 

“I don’t think so. He gave me the money, didn’t he? He said a 
promise is a promise.” 

A week later, a letter came. Hans notified Walter Kugler that he 
would try to send things to help whenever he could. There was a one- 
page map of Molching and Greater Munich, as well as a direct route 
from Pasing (the more reliable train station) to his front door. In his 
letter, the last words were obvious. 

Be careful. 

Midway through May 1940, Mein Kampf arrived, with a key taped to 
the inside cover. 

The man’s a genius, Max decided, but there was still a shudder 
when he thought about traveling to Munich. Clearly, he wished, along 
with the other parties involved, that the journey would not have to be 
made at all. 

You don’t always get what you wish for. 
Especially in Nazi Germany. 

Again, time passed. 

The war expanded. 
Max remained hidden from the world in another empty room. 
Until the inevitable. 

Walter was notified that he was being sent to Poland, to continue 
the assertion of Germany’s authority over both the Poles and Jews 
alike. One was not much better than the other. The time had come. 
Max made his way to Munich and Molching, and now he sat in a 
stranger’s kitchen, asking for the help he craved and suffering the 
condemnation he felt he deserved. 
Hans Hubermann shook his hand and introduced himself. 
He made him some coffee in the dark. 

The girl had been gone quite a while, but now some more footsteps 
had approached arrival. The wildcard. 

In the darkness, all three of them were completely isolated. They all 
stared. Only the woman spoke. 

THE WRATH OF ROSA 

Liesel had drifted back to sleep when the unmistakable voice of Rosa 
Hubermann entered the kitchen. It shocked her awake. 

“Was ist los?” 

Curiosity got the better of her then, as she imagined a tirade 
thrown down from the wrath of Rosa. There was definite movement 
and the shuffle of a chair. 

After ten minutes of excruciating discipline, Liesel made her way to 
the corridor, and what she saw truly amazed her, because Rosa 
Hubermann was at Max Vandenburg’s shoulder, watching him gulp 
down her infamous pea soup. Candlelight was standing at the table. It 
did not waver. 

Mama was grave. 
Her plump figure glowed with worry. 

Somehow, though, there was also a look of triumph on her face, 
and it was not the triumph of having saved another human being 
from persecution. It was something more along the lines of, See? At 
least he’s not complaining. She looked from the soup to the Jew to the 
soup. 
When she spoke again, she asked only if he wanted more. 
Max declined, preferring instead to rush to the sink and vomit. His 

back convulsed and his arms were well spread. His fingers gripped 
the metal. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” Rosa muttered. “Another one.” 

Turning around, Max apologized. His words were slippery and 
small, quelled by the acid. “I’m sorry. I think I ate too much. My 
stomach, you know, it’s been so long since ... I don’t think it can 
handle such—” 

“Move,” Rosa ordered him. She started cleaning up. 

When she was finished, she found the young man at the kitchen 
table, utterly morose. Hans was sitting opposite, his hands cupped 
above the sheet of wood. 

Liesel, from the hallway, could see the drawn face of the stranger, 
and behind it, the worried expression scribbled like a mess onto 
Mama. 

She looked at both her foster parents. 

Who were these people? 

LIESEL’S LECTURE 

Exactly what kind of people Hans and Rosa Hubermann were was not 
the easiest problem to solve. Kind people? Ridiculously ignorant 
people? People of questionable sanity? 

What was easier to define was their predicament. 

e e e THE SITUATION OF HANS AND « « « 
ROSA HUBERMANN 
Very sticky indeed. 

In fact, frightfully sticky. 

When a Jew shows up at your place of residence in the early hours of 
morning, in the very birthplace of Nazism, you’re likely to experience 
extreme levels of discomfort. Anxiety, disbelief, paranoia. Each plays 
its part, and each leads to a sneaking suspicion that a less than 
heavenly consequence awaits. The fear is shiny. Ruthless in the eyes. 

The surprising point to make is that despite this iridescent fear 
glowing as it did in the dark, they somehow resisted the urge for 
hysteria. 

Mama ordered Liesel away. 
“Bett, Saumensch.” The voice calm but firm. Highly unusual. 

Papa came in a few minutes later and lifted the covers on the 
vacant bed. 

“Alles gut, Liesel? Is everything good?” 
“Yes, Papa.” 

“As you can see, we have a visitor.” She could only just make out 
the shape of Hans Hubermann’s tallness in the dark. “He’ll sleep in 
here tonight.” 

“Yes, Papa.” 

A few minutes later, Max Vandenburg was in the room, noiseless 
and opaque. The man did not breathe. He did not move. Yet, 
somehow, he traveled from the doorway to the bed and was under 
the covers. 

“Everything good?” 
It was Papa again, talking this time to Max. 

The reply floated from his mouth, then molded itself like a stain to 
the ceiling. Such was his feeling of shame. “Yes. Thank you.” He said 
it again, when Papa made his way over to his customary position in 
the chair next to Liesel’s bed. “Thank you.” 

Another hour passed before Liesel fell asleep. 
She slept hard and long. 

A hand woke her just after eight-thirty the next morning. 

The voice at the end of it informed her that she would not be 
attending school that day. Apparently, she was sick. 

When she awoke completely, she watched the stranger in the bed 
opposite. The blanket showed only a nest of lopsided hair at the top, 
and there was not a sound, as if he’d somehow trained himself even 
to sleep more quietly. With great care, she walked the length of him, 
following Papa to the hall. 

For the first time ever, the kitchen and Mama were dormant. It was 
a kind of bemused, inaugural silence. To Liesel’s relief, it lasted only a 
few minutes. 

There was food and the sound of eating. 

Mama announced the day’s priority. She sat at the table and said, 
“Now listen, Liesel. Papa’s going to tell you something today.” This 
was serious—she didn’t even say Saumensch. It was a personal feat of 
abstinence. “He'll talk to you and you have to listen. Is that clear?” 

The girl was still swallowing. 
“Is that clear, Saumensch?” 
That was better. 
The girl nodded. 

When she reentered the bedroom to fetch her clothes, the body in the 
opposite bed had turned and curled up. It was no longer a straight log 
but a kind of Z shape, reaching diagonally from corner to corner. 
Zigzagging the bed. 
She could see his face now, in the tired light. His mouth was open 
and his skin was the color of eggshells. Whiskers coated his jaw and 
chin, and his ears were hard and flat. He had a small but misshapen 
nose. 

“Tiesel!” 
She turned. 
“Move it!” 

She moved, to the washroom. 

Once changed and in the hallway, she realized she would not be 
traveling far. Papa was standing in front of the door to the basement. 
He smiled very faintly, lit the lamp, and led her down. 

Among the mounds of drop sheets and the smell of paint, Papa told 
her to make herself comfortable. Ignited on the walls were the 
painted words, learned in the past. “I need to tell you some things.” 

Liesel sat on top of a meter-tall heap of drop sheets, Papa on a 
fifteen-liter paint can. For a few minutes, he searched for the words. 
When they came, he stood to deliver them. He rubbed his eyes. 

“Liesel,” he said quietly, “I was never sure if any of this would 

happen, so I never told you. About me. About the man upstairs.” He 
walked from one end of the basement to the other, the lamplight 
magnifying his shadow. It turned him into a giant on the wall, 
walking back and forth. 

When he stopped pacing, his shadow loomed behind him, 
watching. Someone was always watching. 

“You know my accordion?” he said, and there the story began. 

He explained World War I and Erik Vandenburg, and then the visit to 
the fallen soldier’s wife. “The boy who came into the room that day is 
the man upstairs. Verstehst? Understand?” 

The book thief sat and listened to Hans Hubermann’s story. It lasted 
a good hour, until the moment of truth, which involved a very 
obvious and necessary lecture. 

“Liesel, you must listen.” Papa made her stand up and held her 
hand. 

They faced the wall. 
Dark shapes and the practice of words. 

Firmly, he held her fingers. 

“Remember the Fiihrer’s birthday—when we walked home from the 
fire that night? Remember what you promised me?” 

The girl concurred. To the wall, she said, “That I would keep a 
secret.” 

“That’s right.” Between the hand-holding shadows, the painted 
words were scattered about, perched on their shoulders, resting on 
their heads, and hanging from their arms. “Liesel, if you tell anyone 
about the man up there, we will all be in big trouble.” He walked the 
fine line of scaring her into oblivion and soothing her enough to keep 
her calm. He fed her the sentences and watched with his metallic 

eyes. Desperation and placidity. “At the very least, Mama and I will 
be taken away.” Hans was clearly worried that he was on the verge of 
frightening her too much, but he calculated the risk, preferring to err 
on the side of too much fear rather than not enough. The girl’s 
compliance had to be an absolute, immutable fact. 

Toward the end, Hans Hubermann looked at Liesel Meminger and 
made certain she was focused. 

He gave her a list of consequences. 
“Tf you tell anyone about that man ...” 
Her teacher. 
Rudy. 
It didn’t matter whom. 
What mattered was that all were punishable. 

“For starters,” he said, “I will take each and every one of your books 
—and I will burn them.” It was callous. “I’ll throw them in the stove 
or the fireplace.” He was certainly acting like a tyrant, but it was 
necessary. “Understand?” 

The shock made a hole in her, very neat, very precise. 
Tears welled. 
“Yes, Papa.” 

“Next.” He had to remain hard, and he needed to strain for it. 
“They’ll take you away from me. Do you want that?” 

She was crying now, in earnest. “Nein.” 

“Good.” His grip on her hand tightened. “They’ll drag that man up 
there away, and maybe Mama and me, too—and we will never, ever 
come back.” 

And that did it. 
The girl began to sob so uncontrollably that Papa was dying to pull 

her into him and hug her tight. He didn’t. Instead, he squatted down 
and watched her directly in the eyes. He unleashed his quietest words 
so far. “Verstehst du mich?” Do you understand me?” 

The girl nodded. She cried, and now, defeated, broken, her papa 
held her in the painted air and the kerosene light. 
“T understand, Papa, I do.” 
Her voice was muffled against his body, and they stayed like that 
for a few minutes, Liesel with squashed breath and Papa rubbing her 
back. 
Upstairs, when they returned, they found Mama sitting in the 
kitchen, alone and pensive. When she saw them, she stood and 
beckoned Liesel to come over, noticing the dried-up tears that 
streaked her. She brought the girl into her and heaped a typically 
rugged embrace around her body. “Alles gut, Saumensch?” 
She didn’t need an answer. 
Everything was good. 
But it was awful, too. 

THE SLEEPER 

Max Vandenburg slept for three days. 

In certain excerpts of that sleep, Liesel watched him. You might say 
that by the third day it became an obsession, to check on him, to see 
if he was still breathing. She could now interpret his signs of life, 
from the movement of his lips, his gathering beard, and the twigs of 
hair that moved ever so slightly when his head twitched in the dream 
state. 

Often, when she stood over him, there was the mortifying thought 
that he had just woken up, his eyes splitting open to view her—to 
watch her watching. The idea of being caught out plagued and 
enthused her at the same time. She dreaded it. She invited it. Only 
when Mama called out to her could she drag herself away, 
simultaneously soothed and disappointed that she might not be there 
when he woke. 

Sometimes, close to the end of the marathon of sleep, he spoke. 
There was a recital of murmured names. A checklist. 
Isaac. Aunt Ruth. Sarah. Mama. Walter. Hitler. 
Family, friend, enemy. 

They were all under the covers with him, and at one point, he 
appeared to be struggling with himself. “Nein,” he whispered. It was 
repeated seven times. “No.” 

Liesel, in the act of watching, was already noticing the similarities 
between this stranger and herself. They both arrived in a state of 
agitation on Himmel Street. They both nightmared. 

When the time came, he awoke with the nasty thrill of disorientation. 

His mouth opened a moment after his eyes and he sat up, right- 
angled. 
“Ay!” 
A patch of voice escaped his mouth. 

When he saw the upside-down face of a girl above him, there was 
the fretful moment of unfamiliarity and the grasp for recollection—to 
decode exactly where and when he was currently sitting. After a few 
seconds, he managed to scratch his head (the rustle of kindling) and 
he looked at her. His movements were fragmented, and now that they 
were open, his eyes were swampy and brown. Thick and heavy. 

As a reflex action, Liesel backed away. 
She was too slow. 

The stranger reached out, his bed-warmed hand taking her by the 
forearm. 

“Please.” 

His voice also held on, as if possessing fingernails. He pressed it 
into her flesh. “Papa!” Loud. 
“Please!” Soft. 
It was late afternoon, gray and gleaming, but it was only dirty- 
colored light that was permitted entrance into the room. It was all the 
fabric of the curtains allowed. If you’re optimistic, think of it as 
bronze. 
When Papa came in, he first stood in the doorway and witnessed 
Max Vandenburg’s gripping fingers and his desperate face. Both held 
on to Liesel’s arm. “I see you two have met,” he said. 

Max’s fingers started cooling. 

THE SWAPPING OF NIGHTMARES 

Max Vandenburg promised that he would never sleep in Liesel’s room 
again. What was he thinking that first night? The very idea of it 
mortified him. 

He rationalized that he was so bewildered upon his arrival that he 
allowed such a thing. The basement was the only place for him as far 
as he was concerned. Forget the cold and the loneliness. He was a 
Jew, and if there was one place he was destined to exist, it was a 
basement or any other such hidden venue of survival. 

“Tm sorry,” he confessed to Hans and Rosa on the basement steps. 
“From now on I will stay down here. You will not hear from me. I 
will not make a sound.” 

Hans and Rosa, both steeped in the despair of the predicament, 
made no argument, not even in regard to the cold. They heaved 
blankets down and topped up the kerosene lamp. Rosa admitted that 
there could not be much food, to which Max fervently asked her to 
bring only scraps, and only when they were not wanted by anyone 
else. 

“Na, na,” Rosa assured him. “You will be fed, as best I can.” 

They also took the mattress down, from the spare bed in Liesel’s 
room, replacing it with drop sheets—an excellent trade. 

Downstairs, Hans and Max placed the mattress beneath the steps and 
built a wall of drop sheets at the side. The sheets were high enough to 
cover the whole triangular entrance, and if nothing else, they were 
easily moved if Max was in dire need of extra air. 

Papa apologized. “It’s quite pathetic. I realize that.” 

“Better than nothing,” Max assured him. “Better than I deserve— 
thank you.” 

With some well-positioned paint cans, Hans actually conceded that 
it did simply look like a collection of junk gathered sloppily in the 
corner, out of the way. The one problem was that a person needed 
only to shift a few cans and remove a drop sheet or two to smell out 
the Jew. 

“Let’s just hope it’s good enough,” he said. 
“Tt has to be.” Max crawled in. Again, he said it. “Thank you.” 

Thank you. 

For Max Vandenburg, those were the two most pitiful words he 
could possibly say, rivaled only by I’m sorry. There was a constant 
urge to speak both expressions, spurred on by the affliction of guilt. 

How many times in those first few hours of awakeness did he feel 
like walking out of that basement and leaving the house altogether? It 
must have been hundreds. 

Each time, though, it was only a twinge. 
Which made it even worse. 

He wanted to walk out—Lord, how he wanted to (or at least he 
wanted to want to)—but he knew he wouldn’t. It was much the same 
as the way he left his family in Stuttgart, under a veil of fabricated 
loyalty. 
To live. 
Living was living. 
The price was guilt and shame. 

For his first few days in the basement, Liesel had nothing to do with 
him. She denied his existence. His rustling hair, his cold, slippery 

fingers. 
His tortured presence. 

Mama and Papa. 
There was such gravity between them, and a lot of failed decision- 
making. 
They considered whether they could move him. 
“But where?” 
No reply. 
In this situation, they were friendless and paralyzed. There was 
nowhere else for Max Vandenburg to go. It was them. Hans and Rosa 

Hubermann. Liesel had never seen them look at each other so much, 
or with such solemnity. 

It was they who took the food down and organized an empty paint 
can for Max’s excrement. The contents would be disposed of by Hans 
as prudently as possible. Rosa also took him some buckets of hot 
water to wash himself. The Jew was filthy. 

Outside, a mountain of cold November air was waiting at the front 
door each time Liesel left the house. 

Drizzle came down in spades. 
Dead leaves were slumped on the road. 

Soon enough, it was the book thief’s turn to visit the basement. They 
made her. 

She walked tentatively down the steps, knowing that no words 
were required. The scuffing of her feet was enough to rouse him. 

In the middle of the basement, she stood and waited, feeling more 
like she was standing in the center of a great dusky field. The sun was 
setting behind a crop of harvested drop sheets. 

When Max came out, he was holding Mein Kampf. Upon his arrival, 
he’d offered it back to Hans Hubermann but was told he could keep 
it. 

Naturally, Liesel, while holding the dinner, couldn’t take her eyes 
off it. It was a book she had seen a few times at the BDM, but it 
hadn’t been read or used directly in their activities. There were 
occasional references to its greatness, as well as promises that the 
opportunity to study it would come in later years, as they progressed 
into the more senior Hitler Youth division. 

Max, following her attention, also examined the book. 
“Ts?” she whispered. 

There was a queer strand in her voice, planed off and curly in her 
mouth. 

The Jew moved only his head a little closer. “Bitte? Excuse me?” 
She handed him the pea soup and returned upstairs, red, rushed, and 
foolish. 

“Ts it a good book?” 

She practiced what she’d wanted to say in the washroom, in the 
small mirror. The smell of urine was still about her, as Max had just 
used the paint can before she’d come down. So ein G’schtank, she 
thought. What a stink. 

No one’s urine smells as good as your own. 

The days hobbled on. 

Each night, before the descent into sleep, she would hear Mama 
and Papa in the kitchen, discussing what had been done, what they 
were doing now, and what needed to happen next. All the while, an 
image of Max hovered next to her. It was always the injured, thankful 
expression on his face and the swamp-filled eyes. 

Only once was there an outburst in the kitchen. 

Papa. 
“I know!” 

His voice was abrasive, but he brought it back to a muffled whisper 
in a hurry. 

“I have to keep going, though, at least a few times a week. I can’t 
be here all the time. We need the money, and if I quit playing there, 
they’ll get suspicious. They might wonder why I’ve stopped. I told 
them you were sick last week, but now we have to do everything like 
we always have.” 

Therein lay the problem. 
Life had altered in the wildest possible way, but it was imperative 
that they act as if nothing at all had happened. 
Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it 
twenty-four hours a day. 
That was the business of hiding a Jew. 

As days turned into weeks, there was now, if nothing else, a 
beleaguered acceptance of what had transpired—all the result of war, 
a promise keeper, and one piano accordion. Also, in the space of just 
over half a year, the Hubermanns had lost a son and gained a 
replacement of epically dangerous proportions. 

What shocked Liesel most was the change in her mama. Whether it 
was the calculated way in which she divided the food, or the 
considerable muzzling of her notorious mouth, or even the gentler 
expression on her cardboard face, one thing was becoming clear. 

e ee AN ATTRIBUTE OF ROSA HUBERMANN « « « 
She was a good woman for a crisis. 

Even when the arthritic Helena Schmidt canceled the washing and 
ironing service, a month after Max’s debut on Himmel Street, she 

simply sat at the table and brought the bowl toward her. “Good soup 
tonight.” 

The soup was terrible. 

Every morning when Liesel left for school, or on the days she 
ventured out to play soccer or complete what was left of the washing 
round, Rosa would speak quietly to the girl. “And remember, Liesel 
...” She would point to her mouth and that was all. When Liesel 
nodded, she would say, “Good girl, Saumensch. Now get going.” 

True to Papa’s words, and even Mama’s now, she was a good girl. 
She kept her mouth shut everywhere she went. The secret was buried 
deep. 

She town-walked with Rudy as she always did, listening to his 
jabbering. Sometimes they compared notes from their Hitler Youth 
divisions, Rudy mentioning for the first time a sadistic young leader 
named Franz Deutscher. If Rudy wasn’t talking about Deutscher’s 
intense ways, he was playing his usual broken record, providing 
renditions and re-creations of the last goal he scored in the Himmel 
Street soccer stadium. 

“I know,” Liesel would assure him. “I was there.” 
“So what?” 
“So I saw it, Saukerl.” 

“How do I know that? For all I know, you were probably on the 
ground somewhere, licking up the mud I left behind when I scored.” 
Perhaps it was Rudy who kept her sane, with the stupidity of his 
talk, his lemon-soaked hair, and his cockiness. 
He seemed to resonate with a kind of confidence that life was still 

nothing but a joke—an endless succession of soccer goals, trickery, 
and a constant repertoire of meaningless chatter. 

Also, there was the mayor’s wife, and reading in her husband’s 
library. It was cold in there now, colder with every visit, but still 

Liesel could not stay away. She would choose a handful of books and 
read small segments of each, until one afternoon, she found one she 
could not put down. It was called The Whistler. She was originally 
drawn to it because of her sporadic sightings of the whistler of 
Himmel Street—Pfiffikus. There was the memory of him bent over in 
his coat and his appearance at the bonfire on the Fuhrer’s birthday. 
The first event in the book was a murder. A stabbing. A Vienna 
street. Not far from the Stephansdom—the cathedral in the main 
square. 

e e eA SMALL EXCERPT FROM « « « 
THE WHISTLER 
She lay there, frightened, in a pool of blood, a strange tune 
singing in her ear. She recalled the knife, in and out, and a 
smile. As always, the whistler had smiled as he ran away, into a 
dark and murderous night .... 

Liesel was unsure whether it was the words or the open window that 
caused her to tremble. Every time she picked up or delivered from the 
mayor’s house, she read three pages and shivered, but she could not 
last forever. 

Similarly, Max Vandenburg could not withstand the basement 
much longer. He didn’t complain—he had no right—but he could 
slowly feel himself deteriorating in the cold. As it turned out, his 
rescue owed itself to some reading and writing, and a book called The 
Shoulder Shrug. 

“Liesel,” said Hans one night. “Come on.” 

Since Max’s arrival, there had been a considerable hiatus in the 
reading practice of Liesel and her papa. He clearly felt that now was a 
good time to resume. “Na, komm,” he told her. “I don’t want you 
slacking off. Go and get one of your books. How about The Shoulder 

Shrug?” 
The disturbing element in all of this was that when she came back, 

book in hand, Papa was motioning that she should follow him down 
to their old workroom. The basement. 

“But, Papa,” she tried to tell him. “We can’t—” 
“What? Is there a monster down there?” 

It was early December and the day had been icy. The basement 
became unfriendlier with each concrete step. 

“It’s too cold, Papa.” 
“That never bothered you before.” 
“Yes, but it was never this cold ....” 

When they made their way down, Papa whispered to Max, “Can we 
borrow the lamplight, please?” 

With trepidation, the sheets and cans moved and the light was 
passed out, exchanging hands. Looking at the flame, Hans shook his 
head and followed it with some words. “Es ist ja Wahnsinn, net? This 
is crazy, no?” Before the hand from within could reposition the 
sheets, he caught it. “Bring yourself, too. Please, Max.” 

Slowly then, the drop sheets were dragged aside and the emaciated 
body and face of Max Vandenburg appeared. In the moist light, he 
stood with a magic discomfort. He shivered. 

Hans touched his arm, to bring him closer. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. You cannot stay down here. You'll freeze 
to death.” He turned. “Liesel, fill up the tub. Not too hot. Make it just 
like it is when it starts cooling down.” 

Liesel ran up. 
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” 
She heard it again when she reached the hallway. 

When he was in the pint-sized bath, Liesel listened at the washroom 
door, imagining the tepid water turning to steam as it warmed his 

iceberg body. Mama and Papa were at the climax of debate in the 
combined bedroom and living room, their quiet voices trapped inside 
the corridor wall. 

“He'll die down there, I promise you.” 
“But what if someone sees in?” 

“No, no, he only comes up at night. In the day, we leave everything 
open. Nothing to hide. And we use this room rather than the kitchen. 
Best to keep away from the front door.” 

Silence. 
Then Mama. “All right ... Yes, you’re right.” 

“If we gamble on a Jew,” said Papa soon after, “I would prefer to 
gamble on a live one,” and from that moment, a new routine was 
born. 

Each night, the fire was lit in Mama and Papa’s room, and Max would 
silently appear. He would sit in the corner, cramped and perplexed, 
most likely by the kindness of the people, the torment of survival, and 
overriding all of it, the brilliance of the warmth. 

With the curtains clamped tight, he would sleep on the floor with a 
cushion beneath his head, as the fire slipped away and turned to ash. 

In the morning, he would return to the basement. 
A voiceless human. 
The Jewish rat, back to his hole. 

Christmas came and went with the smell of extra danger. As expected, 
Hans Junior did not come home (both a blessing and an ominous 
disappointment), but Trudy arrived as usual, and fortunately, things 
went smoothly. 

e e ¢ THE QUALITIES OF SMOOTHNESS « « « 
Max remained in the basement. 

Trudy came and went without any suspicion. 

It was decided that Trudy, despite her mild demeanor, could not be 
trusted. 

“We trust only the people we have to,” Papa stated, “and that is the 
three of us.” 

There was extra food and the apology to Max that this was not his 
religion, but a ritual nonetheless. 

He didn’t complain. 
What grounds did he have? 

He explained that he was a Jew in upbringing, in blood, but also 
that Jewry was now more than ever a label—a ruinous piece of the 
dumbest luck around. 

It was then that he also took the opportunity to say he was sorry 
that the Hubermanns’ son had not come home. In response, Papa told 
him that such things were out of their control. “After all,” he said, 
“you should know it yourself—a young man is still a boy, and a boy 
sometimes has the right to be stubborn.” 

They left it at that. 

For the first few weeks in front of the fire, Max remained wordless. 
Now that he was having a proper bath once a week, Liesel noticed 
that his hair was no longer a nest of twigs, but rather a collection of 
feathers, flopping about on his head. Still shy of the stranger, she 
whispered it to her papa. 

“His hair is like feathers.” 
“What?” The fire had distorted the words. 

“I said,” she whispered again, leaning closer, “his hair is like 
feathers ....” 

Hans Hubermann looked across and nodded his agreement. I’m sure 
he was wishing to have eyes like the girl. They didn’t realize that Max 
had heard everything. 

Occasionally he brought the copy of Mein Kampf and read it next to 
the flames, seething at the content. The third time he brought it, 
Liesel finally found the courage to ask her question. 
“Ts it—good?” 
He looked up from the pages, forming his fingers into a fist and 
then flattening them back out. Sweeping away the anger, he smiled at 
her. He lifted the feathery fringe and dumped it toward his eyes. “It’s 
the best book ever.” Looking at Papa, then back at the girl. “It saved 
my life.” 
The girl moved a little and crossed her legs. Quietly, she asked it. 
“How?” 

So began a kind of storytelling phase in the living room each night. It 
was spoken just loud enough to hear. The pieces of a Jewish fist- 
fighting puzzle were assembled before them all. 

Sometimes there was humor in Max Vandenburg’s voice, though its 
physicality was like friction—like a stone being gently rubbed across 
a large rock. It was deep in places and scratched apart in others, 
sometimes breaking off altogether. It was deepest in regret, and 
broken off at the end of a joke or a statement of self-deprecation. 

“Crucified Christ” was the most common reaction to Max 
Vandenburg’s stories, usually followed by a question. 

s e ¢ QUESTIONS LIKE « « « 
How long did you stay in that room? 
Where is Walter Kugler now? 
Do you know what happened to your family? 
Where was the snorer traveling to? 

A 10-3 losing record! 
Why would you keep fighting him? 

When Liesel looked back on the events of her life, those nights in the 
living room were some of the clearest memories she had. She could 
see the burning light on Max’s eggshell face and even taste the human 
flavor of his words. The course of his survival was related, piece by 
piece, as if he were cutting each part out of him and presenting it on 
a plate. 

“Pm so selfish.” 
When he said that, he used his forearm to shield his face. “Leaving 
people behind. Coming here. Putting all of you in danger ...” He 
dropped everything out of him and started pleading with them. 
Sorrow and desolation were clouted across his face. “?’m sorry. Do 
you believe me? I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m—!” 
His arm touched the fire and he snapped it back. 

They all watched him, silent, until Papa stood and walked closer. 
He sat next to him. 

“Did you burn your elbow?” 

One evening, Hans, Max, and Liesel were sitting in front of the fire. 
Mama was in the kitchen. Max was reading Mein Kampf again. 
“You know something?” Hans said. He leaned toward the fire. 
“Liesel’s actually a good little reader herself.” Max lowered the book. 
“And she has more in common with you than you might think.” Papa 
checked that Rosa wasn’t coming. “She likes a good fistfight, too.” 
“Papa!” 
Liesel, at the high end of eleven, and still rake-skinny as she sat 
against the wall, was devastated. “I’ve never been in a fight!” 

“Shhh,” Papa laughed. He waved at her to keep her voice down and 

tilted again, this time to the girl. “Well, what about the hiding you 
gave Ludwig Schmeikl, huh?” 

“T never—” She was caught. Further denial was useless. “How did 
you find out about that?” 

“T saw his papa at the Knoller.” 

Liesel held her face in her hands. Once uncovered again, she asked 
the pivotal question. “Did you tell Mama?” 

“Are you kidding?” He winked at Max and whispered to the girl, 
“Yourre still alive, aren’t you?” 

That night was also the first time Papa played his accordion at home 
for months. It lasted half an hour or so until he asked a question of 
Max. 

“Did you learn?” 

The face in the corner watched the flames. “I did.” There was a 
considerable pause. “Until I was nine. At that age, my mother sold the 
music studio and stopped teaching. She kept only the one instrument 
but gave up on me not long after I resisted the learning. I was 
foolish.” 

“No,” Papa said. “You were a boy.” 

During the nights, both Liesel Meminger and Max Vandenburg would 
go about their other similarity. In their separate rooms, they would 
dream their nightmares and wake up, one with a scream in drowning 
sheets, the other with a gasp for air next to a smoking fire. 

Sometimes, when Liesel was reading with Papa close to three 
o’clock, they would both hear the waking moment of Max. “He 
dreams like you,” Papa would say, and on one occasion, stirred by the 
sound of Max’s anxiety, Liesel decided to get out of bed. From 
listening to his history, she had a good idea of what he saw in those 
dreams, if not the exact part of the story that paid him a visit each 
night. 

She made her way quietly down the hallway and into the living and 
bedroom. 

“Max?” 
The whisper was soft, clouded in the throat of sleep. 

To begin with, there was no sound of reply, but he soon sat up and 
searched the darkness. 

With Papa still in her bedroom, Liesel sat on the other side of the 
fireplace from Max. Behind them, Mama loudly slept. She gave the 
snorer on the train a good run for her money. 

The fire was nothing now but a funeral of smoke, dead and dying, 
simultaneously. On this particular morning, there were also voices. 

e e ¢ THE SWAPPING OF NIGHTMARES « « « 
The girl: “Tell me. What do you see when you dream like that?” 
The Jew: “... I see myself turning around, and waving goodbye.” 
The girl: “I also have nightmares.” 
The Jew: “What do you see?” 
The girl: “A train, and my dead brother.” 
The Jew: “Your brother?” 
The girl: “He died when I moved here, on the way.” 
The girl and the Jew, together: “Ja—yes.” 

It would be nice to say that after this small breakthrough, neither 
Liesel nor Max dreamed their bad visions again. It would be nice but 
untrue. The nightmares arrived like they always did, much like the 
best player in the opposition when you’ve heard rumors that he might 
be injured or sick—but there he is, warming up with the rest of them, 
ready to take the field. Or like a timetabled train, arriving at a nightly 
platform, pulling the memories behind it on a rope. A lot of dragging. 
A lot of awkward bounces. 

The only thing that changed was that Liesel told her papa that she 

should be old enough now to cope on her own with the dreams. For a 
moment, he looked a little hurt, but as always with Papa, he gave the 
right thing to say his best shot. 

“Well, thank God.” He halfway grinned. “At least now I can get 
some proper sleep. That chair was killing me.” He put his arm around 
the girl and they walked to the kitchen. 

As time progressed, a clear distinction developed between two very 
different worlds—the world inside 33 Himmel Street, and the one 
that resided and turned outside it. The trick was to keep them apart. 

In the outside world, Liesel was learning to find some more of its 
uses. One afternoon, when she was walking home with an empty 
washing bag, she noticed a newspaper poking out of a garbage can. 
The weekly edition of the Molching Express. She lifted it out and took 
it home, presenting it to Max. “I thought,” she told him, “you might 
like to do the crossword to pass the time.” 

Max appreciated the gesture, and to justify her bringing it home, he 
read the paper from cover to cover and showed her the puzzle a few 
hours later, completed but for one word. 

“Damn that seventeen down,” he said. 

In February 1941, for her twelfth birthday, Liesel received another 
used book, and she was grateful. It was called The Mud Men and was 
about a very strange father and son. She hugged her mama and papa, 
while Max stood uncomfortably in the corner. 

“Alles Gute zum Geburtstag.” He smiled weakly. “All the best for 
your birthday.” His hands were in his pockets. “I didn’t know, or else 
I could have given you something.” A blatant lie—he had nothing to 
give, except maybe Mein Kampf, and there was no way he’d give such 
propaganda to a young German girl. That would be like the lamb 
handing a knife to the butcher. 

There was an uncomfortable silence. 

She had embraced Mama and Papa. 
Max looked so alone. 

Liesel swallowed. 

And she walked over and hugged him for the first time. “Thanks, 
Max.” 

At first, he merely stood there, but as she held on to him, gradually 
his hands rose up and gently pressed into her shoulder blades. 

Only later would she find out about the helpless expression on Max 
Vandenburg’s face. She would also discover that he resolved at that 
moment to give her something back. I often imagine him lying awake 
all that night, pondering what he could possibly offer. 

As it turned out, the gift was delivered on paper, just over a week 
later. 
He would bring it to her in the early hours of morning, before 
retreating down the concrete steps to what he now liked to call home. 

PAGES FROM THE BASEMENT 

For a week, Liesel was kept from the basement at all cost. It was 
Mama and Papa who made sure to take down Max’s food. 

“No, Saumensch,” Mama told her each time she volunteered. There 
was always a new excuse. “How about you do something useful in 
here for a change, like finish the ironing? You think carrying it around 
town is so special? Try ironing it!” You can do all manner of 
underhanded nice things when you have a caustic reputation. It 
worked. 

During that week, Max had cut out a collection of pages from Mein 
Kampf and painted over them in white. He then hung them up with 
pegs on some string, from one end of the basement to the other. 
When they were all dry, the hard part began. He was educated well 
enough to get by, but he was certainly no writer, and no artist. 
Despite this, he formulated the words in his head till he could recount 
them without error. Only then, on the paper that had bubbled and 
humped under the stress of drying paint, did he begin to write the 
story. It was done with a small black paintbrush. 

The Standover Man. 

He calculated that he needed thirteen pages, so he painted forty, 
expecting at least twice as many slipups as successes. There were 
practice versions on the pages of the Molching Express, improving his 
basic, clumsy artwork to a level he could accept. As he worked, he 
heard the whispered words of a girl. “His hair,” she told him, “is like 
feathers.” 

When he was finished, he used a knife to pierce the pages and tie 

them with string. The result was a thirteen-page booklet that went 
like this:

thet the best standovep man 

Ive ever known is not a 
man at all... 


In late February, when Liesel woke up in the early hours of morning, 
a figure made its way into her bedroom. Typical of Max, it was as 
close as possible to a noiseless shadow. 

Liesel, searching through the dark, could only vaguely sense the 
man coming toward her. 

“Hello?” 

There was no reply. 

There was nothing but the near silence of his feet as he came closer to 
the bed and placed the pages on the floor, next to her socks. The 
pages crackled. Just slightly. One edge of them curled into the floor. 
“Hello?” 
This time there was a response. 

She couldn’t tell exactly where the words came from. What 
mattered was that they reached her. They arrived and kneeled next to 
the bed. 

“A late birthday gift. Look in the morning. Good night.” 

For a while, she drifted in and out of sleep, not sure anymore whether 
she’d dreamed of Max coming in. 
In the morning, when she woke and rolled over, she saw the pages 
sitting on the floor. She reached down and picked them up, listening 
to the paper as it rippled in her early-morning hands. 
All my life, I’ve been scared of men standing over me .... 

As she turned them, the pages were noisy, like static around the 
written story. 

Three days, they told me ... and what did I find when I woke up? 

There were the erased pages of Mein Kampf, gagging, suffocating 
under the paint as they turned. 

It makes me understand that the best standover man I’ve ever known ... 

Liesel read and viewed Max Vandenburg’s gift three times, noticing a 
different brush line or word with each one. When the third reading 
was finished, she climbed as quietly as she could from her bed and 
walked to Mama and Papa’s room. The allocated space next to the fire 
was vacant. 

As she thought about it, she realized it was actually appropriate, or 
even better—perfect—to thank him where the pages were made. 

She walked down the basement steps. She saw an imaginary framed 

photo seep into the wall—a quiet-smiled secret. 

No more than a few meters, it was a long walk to the drop sheets and 
the assortment of paint cans that shielded Max Vandenburg. She 
removed the sheets closest to the wall until there was a small corridor 
to look through. 

The first part of him she saw was his shoulder, and through the 
slender gap, she slowly, painfully, inched her hand in until it rested 
there. His clothing was cool. He did not wake. 

She could feel his breathing and his shoulder moving up and down 
ever so slightly. For a while, she watched him. Then she sat and 
leaned back. 
Sleepy air seemed to have followed her. 
The scrawled words of practice stood magnificently on the wall by 
the stairs, jagged and childlike and sweet. They looked on as both the 
hidden Jew and the girl slept, hand to shoulder. 
They breathed. 
German and Jewish lungs. 

Next to the wall, The Standover Man sat, numb and gratified, like a 
beautiful itch at Liesel Meminger’s feet. 

PART FIVE 

the whistler 

featuring: 
a floating book—the gamblers—a small ghost— 
two haircuts—rudy’s youth—losers and sketches— 
a whistler and some shoes—three acts of stupidity— 

and a frightened boy with frozen legs 

THE FLOATING BOOK (Part I) 

A book floated down the Amper River. 
A boy jumped in, caught up to it, and held it in his right hand. He 
grinned. 
He stood waist-deep in the icy, Decemberish water. 
“How about a kiss, Saumensch?” he said. 
The surrounding air was a lovely, gorgeous, nauseating cold, not to 
mention the concrete ache of the water, thickening from his toes to 
his hips. 
How about a kiss? 
How about a kiss? 
Poor Rudy. 

e © «A SMALL ANNOUNCEMENT « « « 
ABOUT RUDY STEINER 
He didn’t deserve to die the way he did. 

In your visions, you see the sloppy edges of paper still stuck to his 
fingers. You see a shivering blond fringe. Preemptively, you conclude, 
as I would, that Rudy died that very same day, of hypothermia. He 
did not. Recollections like those merely remind me that he was not 
deserving of the fate that met him a little under two years later. 

On many counts, taking a boy like Rudy was robbery—so much 
life, so much to live for—yet somehow, I’m certain he would have 
loved to see the frightening rubble and the swelling of the sky on the 
night he passed away. He’d have cried and turned and smiled if only 
he could have seen the book thief on her hands and knees, next to his 
decimated body. He’d have been glad to witness her kissing his dusty, 

bomb-hit lips. 
Yes, I know it. 

In the darkness of my dark-beating heart, I know. He’d have loved 
it, all right. 

You see? 
Even death has a heart. 

THE GAMBLERS 
(A SEVEN-SIDED DIE) 

Of course, I’m being rude. I’m spoiling the ending, not only of the 
entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have given you two 
events in advance, because I don’t have much interest in building 
mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and 
so do you. It’s the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, 
perplex, interest, and astound me. 
There are many things to think of. 
There is much story. 
Certainly, there’s a book called The Whistler, which we really need 
to discuss, along with exactly how it came to be floating down the 
Amper River in the time leading up to Christmas 1941. We should 
deal with all of that first, don’t you think? 

It’s settled, then. 
We will. 

It started with gambling. Roll a die by hiding a Jew and this is how 
you live. This is how it looks. 

[-\ The Haircut: Mid-April 1941 

Life was at least starting to mimic normality with more force: 

Hans and Rosa Hubermann were arguing in the living room, even if 
it was much quieter than it used to be. Liesel, in typical fashion, was 
an onlooker. 

The argument originated the previous night, in the basement, 

where Hans and Max were sitting with paint cans, words, and drop 
sheets. Max asked if Rosa might be able to cut his hair at some stage. 
“It’s getting me in the eyes,” he’d said, to which Hans had replied, 
“Tl see what I can do.” 

Now Rosa was riffling through the drawers. Her words were shoved 
back to Papa with the rest of the junk. “Where are those damn 
scissors?” 

“Not in the one below?” 
“T’ve been through that one already.” 
“Maybe you missed them.” 
“Do I look blind?” She raised her head and bellowed. “Liesel!” 
“Tm right here.” 
Hans cowered. “Goddamn it, woman, deafen me, why don’t you!” 
“Quiet, Saukerl.” Rosa went on riffling and addressed the girl. 
“Liesel, where are the scissors?” But Liesel had no idea, either. 
“Saumensch, you’re useless, aren’t you?” 
“Leave her out of it.” 

More words were delivered back and forth, from elastic-haired 
woman to silver-eyed man, till Rosa slammed the drawer. “I'll 
probably make a lot of mistakes on him anyway.” 

“Mistakes?” Papa looked ready to tear his own hair out by that 
stage, but his voice became a barely audible whisper. “Who the hell’s 
going to see him?” He motioned to speak again but was distracted by 
the feathery appearance of Max Vandenburg, who stood politely, 
embarrassed, in the doorway. He carried his own scissors and came 
forward, handing them not to Hans or Rosa but to the twelve-year-old 
girl. She was the calmest option. His mouth quivered a moment 
before he said, “Would you?” 

Liesel took the scissors and opened them. They were rusty and 
shiny in different areas. She turned to Papa, and when he nodded, she 
followed Max down to the basement. 

The Jew sat on a paint can. A small drop sheet was wrapped 

around his shoulders. “As many mistakes as you want,” he told her. 
Papa parked himself on the steps. 
Liesel lifted the first tufts of Max Vandenburg’s hair. 

As she cut the feathery strands, she wondered at the sound of 
scissors. Not the snipping noise, but the grinding of each metal arm as 
it cropped each group of fibers. 

When the job was done, a little severe in places, a little crooked in 
others, she walked upstairs with the hair in her hands and fed it into 
the stove. She lit a match and watched as the clump shriveled and 
sank, orange and red. 
Again, Max was in the doorway, this time at the top of the 
basement steps. “Thanks, Liesel.” His voice was tall and husky, with 
the sound in it of a hidden smile. 

No sooner had he spoken than he disappeared again, back into the 
ground. 

E] The Newspaper: Early May 

“There’s a Jew in my basement.” 
“There’s a Jew. In my basement.” 

Sitting on the floor of the mayor’s roomful of books, Liesel Meminger 
heard those words. A bag of washing was at her side and the ghostly 
figure of the mayor’s wife was sitting hunch-drunk over at the desk. 
In front of her, Liesel read The Whistler, pages twenty-two and twenty- 
three. She looked up. She imagined herself walking over, gently 
tearing some fluffy hair to the side, and whispering in the woman’s 
ear: 

“There’s a Jew in my basement.” 

As the book quivered in her lap, the secret sat in her mouth. It 
made itself comfortable. It crossed its legs. 

“I should be getting home.” This time, she actually spoke. Her 

hands were shaking. Despite a trace of sunshine in the distance, a 
gentle breeze rode through the open window, coupled with rain that 
came in like sawdust. 

When Liesel placed the book back into position, the woman’s chair 
stubbed the floor and she made her way over. It was always like this 
at the end. The gentle rings of sorrowful wrinkles swelled a moment 
as she reached across and retrieved the book. 

She offered it to the girl. 
Liesel shied away. 

“No,” she said, “thank you. I have enough books at home. Maybe 
another time. Pm rereading something else with my papa. You know, 
the one I stole from the fire that night.” 

The mayor’s wife nodded. If there was one thing about Liesel 
Meminger, her thieving was not gratuitous. She only stole books on 
what she felt was a need-to-have basis. Currently, she had enough. 
She’d gone through The Mud Men four times now and was enjoying 
her reacquaintance with The Shoulder Shrug. Also, each night before 
bed, she would open a fail-safe guide to grave digging. Buried deep 
inside it, The Standover Man resided. She mouthed the words and 
touched the birds. She turned the noisy pages, slowly. 

“Goodbye, Frau Hermann.” 

She exited the library, walked down the floorboard hall and out the 
monstrous doorway. As was her habit, she stood for a while on the 
steps, looking at Molching beneath her. The town that afternoon was 
covered in a yellow mist, which stroked the rooftops as if they were 
pets and filled up the streets like a bath. 

When she made it down to Munich Street, the book thief swerved 
in and out of the umbrellaed men and women—a rain-cloaked girl 
who made her way without shame from one garbage can to another. 
Like clockwork. 

“There!” 

She laughed up at the coppery clouds, celebrating, before reaching 
in and taking the mangled newspaper. Although the front and back 

pages were streaked with black tears of print, she folded it neatly in 
half and tucked it under her arm. It had been like this each Thursday 
for the past few months. 

Thursday was the only delivery day left for Liesel Meminger now, 
and it was usually able to provide some sort of dividend. She could 
never dampen the feeling of victory each time she found a Molching 
Express or any other publication. Finding a newspaper was a good 
day. If it was a paper in which the crossword wasn’t done, it was a 
great day. She would make her way home, shut the door behind her, 
and take it down to Max Vandenburg. 

“Crossword?” he would ask. 
“Empty. 99 
“Fxcellent.” 

The Jew would smile as he accepted the package of paper and 
started reading in the rationed light of the basement. Often, Liesel 
would watch him as he focused on reading the paper, completed the 
crossword, and then started to reread it, front to back. 

With the weather warming, Max remained downstairs all the time. 
During the day, the basement door was left open to allow the small 
bay of daylight to reach him from the corridor. The hall itself was not 
exactly bathed in sunshine, but in certain situations, you take what 
you can get. Dour light was better than none, and they needed to be 
frugal. The kerosene had not yet approached a dangerously low level, 
but it was best to keep its usage to a minimum. 

Liesel would usually sit on some drop sheets. She would read while 
Max completed those crosswords. They sat a few meters apart, 
speaking very rarely, and there was really only the noise of turning 
pages. Often, she also left her books for Max to read while she was at 
school. Where Hans Hubermann and Erik Vandenburg were 
ultimately united by music, Max and Liesel were held together by the 
quiet gathering of words. 

“Hi, Max.” 
“Hi, Liesel.” 

They would sit and read. 

At times, she would watch him. She decided that he could best be 
summed up as a picture of pale concentration. Beige-colored skin. A 
swamp in each eye. And he breathed like a fugitive. Desperate yet 
soundless. It was only his chest that gave him away for something 
alive. 

Increasingly, Liesel would close her eyes and ask Max to quiz her 
on the words she was continually getting wrong, and she would swear 
if they still escaped her. She would then stand and paint those words 
to the wall, anywhere up to a dozen times. Together, Max 
Vandenburg and Liesel Meminger would take in the odor of paint 
fumes and cement. 

“Bye, Max.” 
“Bye, Liesel.” 
In bed, she would lie awake, imagining him below, in the 
basement. In her bedtime visions, he always slept fully clothed, shoes 
included, just in case he needed to flee again. He slept with one eye 
open. 

{=} The Weatherman: Mid-May 

Liesel opened the door and her mouth simultaneously. 

On Himmel Street, her team had trounced Rudy’s 6-1, and 
triumphant, she burst into the kitchen, telling Mama and Papa all 
about the goal she’d scored. She then rushed down to the basement to 
describe it blow by blow to Max, who put down his newspaper and 
intently listened and laughed with the girl. 

When the story of the goal was complete, there was silence for a 
good few minutes, until Max looked slowly up. “Would you do 
something for me, Liesel?” 
Still excited by her Himmel Street goal, the girl jumped from the 
drop sheets. She did not say it, but her movement clearly showed her 
intent to provide exactly what he wanted. 

“You told me all about the goal,” he said, “but I don’t know what 
sort of day it is up there. I don’t know if you scored it in the sun, or if 
the clouds have covered everything.” His hand prodded at his short- 
cropped hair, and his swampy eyes pleaded for the simplest of simple 
things. “Could you go up and tell me how the weather looks?” 

Naturally, Liesel hurried up the stairs. She stood a few feet from the 
spit-stained door and turned on the spot, observing the sky. 

When she returned to the basement, she told him. 

“The sky is blue today, Max, and there is a big long cloud, and it’s 
stretched out, like a rope. At the end of it, the sun is like a yellow 
hole ....” 

Max, at that moment, knew that only a child could have given him 
a weather report like that. On the wall, he painted a long, tightly 
knotted rope with a dripping yellow sun at the end of it, as if you 
could dive right into it. On the ropy cloud, he drew two figures—a 
thin girl and a withering Jew—and they were walking, arms 
balanced, toward that dripping sun. Beneath the picture, he wrote the 
following sentence. 

e e ¢e THE WALL-WRITTEN WORDS « « « 
OF MAX VANDENBURG 
It was a Monday, and they walked 
on a tightrope to the sun. 

{| The Boxer: End of May 

For Max Vandenburg, there was cool cement and plenty of time to 
spend with it. 

The minutes were cruel. 
Hours were punishing. 

Standing above him at all moments of awakeness was the hand of 
time, and it didn’t hesitate to wring him out. It smiled and squeezed 

and let him live. What great malice there could be in allowing 
something to live. 

At least once a day, Hans Hubermann would descend the basement 
steps and share a conversation. Rosa would occasionally bring a spare 
crust of bread. It was when Liesel came down, however, that Max 
found himself most interested in life again. Initially, he tried to resist, 
but it was harder every day that the girl appeared, each time with a 
new weather report, either of pure blue sky, cardboard clouds, or a 
sun that had broken through like God sitting down after he’d eaten 
too much for his dinner. 

When he was alone, his most distinct feeling was of disappearance. 
All of his clothes were gray—whether they’d started out that way or 
not—from his pants to his woolen sweater to the jacket that dripped 
from him now like water. He often checked if his skin was flaking, for 
it was as if he were dissolving. 

What he needed was a series of new projects. The first was exercise. 
He started with push-ups, lying stomach-down on the cool basement 
floor, then hoisting himself up. It felt like his arms snapped at each 
elbow, and he envisaged his heart seeping out of him and dropping 
pathetically to the ground. As a teenager in Stuttgart, he could reach 
fifty push-ups at a time. Now, at the age of twenty-four, perhaps 
fifteen pounds lighter than his usual weight, he could barely make it 
to ten. After a week, he was completing three sets each of sixteen 
push-ups and twenty-two sit-ups. When he was finished, he would sit 
against the basement wall with his paint-can friends, feeling his pulse 
in his teeth. His muscles felt like cake. 

He wondered at times if pushing himself like this was even worth 
it. Sometimes, though, when his heartbeat neutralized and his body 
became functional again, he would turn off the lamp and stand in the 
darkness of the basement. 

He was twenty-four, but he could still fantasize. 

99 

“In the blue corner,” he quietly commentated, “we have the 
champion of the world, the Aryan masterpiece—the Führer.” He 
breathed and turned. “And in the red corner, we have the Jewish, rat- 

faced challenger—Max Vandenburg.” 
Around him, it all materialized. 

White light lowered itself into a boxing ring and a crowd stood and 
murmured—that magical sound of many people talking all at once. 
How could every person there have so much to say at the same time? 
The ring itself was perfect. Perfect canvas, lovely ropes. Even the 
stray hairs of each thickened string were flawless, gleaming in the 
tight white light. The room smelled like cigarettes and beer. 

Diagonally across, Adolf Hitler stood in the corner with his 
entourage. His legs poked out from a red-and-white robe with a black 
swastika burned into its back. His mustache was knitted to his face. 
Words were whispered to him from his trainer, Goebbels. He bounced 
foot to foot, and he smiled. He smiled loudest when the ring 
announcer listed his many achievements, which were all vociferously 
applauded by the adoring crowd. “Undefeated!” the ringmaster 
proclaimed. “Over many a Jew, and over any other threat to the 
German ideal! Herr Führer,” he concluded, “we salute you!” The 
crowd: mayhem. 

Next, when everyone had settled down, came the challenger. 

The ringmaster swung over toward Max, who stood alone in the 
challenger’s corner. No robe. No entourage. Just a lonely young Jew 
with dirty breath, a naked chest, and tired hands and feet. Naturally, 
his shorts were gray. He too moved from foot to foot, but it was kept 
at a minimum to conserve energy. He’d done a lot of sweating in the 
gym to make the weight. 

“The challenger!” sang the ringmaster. “Of,” and he paused for 
effect, “Jewish blood.” The crowd oohed, like human ghouls. 
“Weighing in at ...” 
The rest of the speech was not heard. It was overrun with the abuse 
from the bleachers, and Max watched as his opponent was de-robed 
and came to the middle to hear the rules and shake hands. 

“Guten Tag, Herr Hitler.” Max nodded, but the Führer only showed 
him his yellow teeth, then covered them up again with his lips. 

“Gentlemen,” a stout referee in black pants and a blue shirt began. 
A bow tie was fixed to his throat. “First and foremost, we want a good 
clean fight.” He addressed only the Führer now. “Unless, of course, 
Herr Hitler, you begin to lose. Should this occur, I will be quite 
willing to turn a blind eye to any unconscionable tactics you might 
employ to grind this piece of Jewish stench and filth into the canvas.” 
He nodded, with great courtesy. “Is that clear?” 

The Fuhrer spoke his first word then. “Crystal.” 

To Max, the referee extended a warning. “As for you, my Jewish 
chum, I’d watch my step very closely if I were you. Very closely 
indeed,” and they were sent back to their respective corners. 

A brief quiet ensued. 
The bell. 

First out was the Fuhrer, awkward-legged and bony, running at Max 
and jabbing him firmly in the face. The crowd vibrated, the bell still 
in their ears, and their satisfied smiles hurdled the ropes. The smoky 
breath of Hitler steamed from his mouth as his hands bucked at Max’s 
face, collecting him several times, on the lips, the nose, the chin—and 
Max had still not ventured out of his corner. To absorb the 
punishment, he held up his hands, but the Führer then aimed at his 
ribs, his kidneys, his lungs. Oh, the eyes, the Führer‘s eyes. They were 
so deliciously brown—like Jews’ eyes—and they were so determined 
that even Max stood transfixed for a moment as he caught sight of 
them between the healthy blur of punching gloves. 

There was only one round, and it lasted hours, and for the most 
part, nothing changed. 

The Führer pounded away at the punching-bag Jew. 
Jewish blood was everywhere. 
Like red rain clouds on the white-sky canvas at their feet. 

Eventually, Max’s knees began to buckle, his cheekbones silently 
moaned, and the Fuhrer‘s delighted face still chipped away, chipped 
away, until depleted, beaten, and broken, the Jew flopped to the 
floor. 

First, a roar. 
Then silence. 

The referee counted. He had a gold tooth and a plethora of nostril 
hair. 

Slowly, Max Vandenburg, the Jew, rose to his feet and made 
himself upright. His voice wobbled. An invitation. “Come on, Fuhrer,” 
he said, and this time, when Adolf Hitler set upon his Jewish 
counterpart, Max stepped aside and plunged him into the corner. He 
punched him seven times, aiming on each occasion for only one 
thing. 
The mustache. 

With the seventh punch, he missed. It was the Fuihrer’s chin that 
sustained the blow. All at once, Hitler hit the ropes and creased 
forward, landing on his knees. This time, there was no count. The 
referee flinched in the corner. The audience sank down, back to their 
beer. On his knees, the Führer tested himself for blood and 
straightened his hair, right to left. When he returned to his feet, much 
to the approval of the thousand-strong crowd, he edged forward and 
did something quite strange. He turned his back on the Jew and took 
the gloves from his fists. 

The crowd was stunned.

“He’s given up,” someone whispered, but within moments, Adolf 
Hitler was standing on the ropes, and he was addressing the arena. 

“My fellow Germans,” he called, “you can see something here 
tonight, can’t you?” Bare-chested, victory-eyed, he pointed over at 
Max. “You can see that what we face is something far more sinister 
and powerful than we ever imagined. Can you see that?” 

They answered. “Yes, Fuhrer.” 

“Can you see that this enemy has found its ways—its despicable 
ways—through our armor, and that clearly, I cannot stand up here 
alone and fight him?” The words were visible. They dropped from his 
mouth like jewels. “Look at him! Take a good look.” They looked. At 
the bloodied Max Vandenburg. “As we speak, he is plotting his way 

into your neighborhood. He’s moving in next door. He’s infesting you 
with his family and he’s about to take you over. He—” Hitler glanced 
at him a moment, with disgust. “He will soon own you, until it is he 
who stands not at the counter of your grocery shop, but sits in the 
back, smoking his pipe. Before you know it, you’ll be working for him 
at minimum wage while he can hardly walk from the weight in his 
pockets. Will you simply stand there and let him do this? Will you 
stand by as your leaders did in the past, when they gave your land to 
everybody else, when they sold your country for the price of a few 
signatures? Will you stand out there, powerless? Or’—and now he 
stepped one rung higher—“will you climb up into this ring with me?” 

Max shook. Horror stuttered in his stomach. 

Adolf finished him. “Will you climb in here so that we can defeat 
this enemy together?” 

In the basement of 33 Himmel Street, Max Vandenburg could feel 
the fists of an entire nation. One by one they climbed into the ring 
and beat him down. They made him bleed. They let him suffer. 
Millions of them—until one last time, when he gathered himself to his 
feet ... 

He watched the next person climb through the ropes. It was a girl, 
and as she slowly crossed the canvas, he noticed a tear torn down her 
left cheek. In her right hand was a newspaper. 

“The crossword,” she gently said, “is empty,” and she held it out to 
him. 
Dark. 
Nothing but dark now. 
Just basement. Just Jew. 

The New Dream: A Few Nights Later 

It was afternoon. Liesel came down the basement steps. Max was 
halfway through his push-ups. 

She watched awhile, without his knowledge, and when she came 

and sat with him, he stood up and leaned back against the wall. “Did 
I tell you,” he asked her, “that lve been having a new dream lately?” 

Liesel shifted a little, to see his face. 

“But I dream this when ’m awake.” He motioned to the glowless 
kerosene lamp. “Sometimes I turn out the light. Then I stand here and 
wait.” 
“For what?” 
Max corrected her. “Not for what. For whom.” 
For a few moments, Liesel said nothing. It was one of those 
conversations that require some time to elapse between exchanges. 
“Who do you wait for?” 
Max did not move. “The Führer.” He was very matter-of-fact about 
this. “That’s why I’m in training.” 
“The push-ups?” 
“That’s right.” He walked to the concrete stairway. “Every night, I 
wait in the dark and the Fuhrer comes down these steps. He walks 
down and he and I, we fight for hours.” 
Liesel was standing now. “Who wins?” 
At first, he was going to answer that no one did, but then he 
noticed the paint cans, the drop sheets, and the growing pile of 
newspapers in the periphery of his vision. He watched the words, the 
long cloud, and the figures on the wall. 
“I do,” he said. 

It was as though he’d opened her palm, given her the words, and 
closed it up again. 

Under the ground, in Molching, Germany, two people stood and 
spoke in a basement. It sounds like the beginning of a joke: 

“There’s a Jew and a German standing in a basement, right? ... 
This, however, was no joke. 

The Painters: Early June 

Another of Max’s projects was the remainder of Mein Kampf. Each 
page was gently stripped from the book and laid out on the floor to 
receive a coat of paint. It was then hung up to dry and replaced 
between the front and back covers. When Liesel came down one day 
after school, she found Max, Rosa, and her papa all painting the 
various pages. Many of them were already hanging from a drawn-out 
string with pegs, just as they must have done for The Standover Man. 

All three people looked up and spoke. 
“Hi, Liesel.” 
“Here’s a brush, Liesel.” 
“About time, Saumensch. Where have you been so long?” 

As she started painting, Liesel thought about Max Vandenburg 
fighting the Führer, exactly as he’d explained it. 

e e e BASEMENTVISIONS, JUNE 1941 « « « 
Punches are thrown, the crowd climbs out of 
the walls. Max and the Fuhrer fight for their 
lives, each rebounding off the stairway. 
There’s blood in the Fiihrer’s mustache, as 
well as in his part line, on the right side 
of his head. “Come on, Fuhrer,” says the 
Jew. He waves him forward. “Come on, Fuhrer.” 

When the visions dissipated and she finished her first page, Papa 
winked at her. Mama castigated her for hogging the paint. Max 
examined each and every page, perhaps watching what he planned to 
produce on them. Many months later, he would also paint over the 
cover of that book and give it a new title, after one of the stories he 
would write and illustrate inside it. 

That afternoon, in the secret ground below 33 Himmel Street, the 
Hubermanns, Liesel Meminger, and Max Vandenburg prepared the 

pages of The Word Shaker. 
It felt good to be a painter. 

The Showdown: June 24 

Then came the seventh side of the die. Two days after Germany 
invaded Russia. Three days before Britain and the Soviets joined 
forces. 

Seven. 

You roll and watch it coming, realizing completely that this is no 
regular die. You claim it to be bad luck, but you’ve known all along 
that it had to come. You brought it into the room. The table could 
smell it on your breath. The Jew was sticking out of your pocket from 
the outset. He’s smeared to your lapel, and the moment you roll, you 
know it’s a seven—the one thing that somehow finds a way to hurt 
you. It lands. It stares you in each eye, miraculous and loathsome, 
and you turn away with it feeding on your chest. 

Just bad luck. 
That’s what you say. 
Of no consequence. 

That’s what you make yourself believe—because deep down, you 
know that this small piece of changing fortune is a signal of things to 
come. You hide a Jew. You pay. Somehow or other, you must. 

In hindsight, Liesel told herself that it was not such a big deal. 
Perhaps it was because so much more had happened by the time she 
wrote her story in the basement. In the great scheme of things, she 
reasoned that Rosa being fired by the mayor and his wife was not bad 
luck at all. It had nothing whatsoever to do with hiding Jews. It had 
everything to do with the greater context of the war. At the time, 
though, there was most definitely a feeling of punishment. 

The beginning was actually a week or so earlier than June 24. Liesel 
scavenged a newspaper for Max Vandenburg as she always did. She 
reached into a garbage can just off Munich Street and tucked it under 
her arm. Once she delivered it to Max and he’d commenced his first 
reading, he glanced across at her and pointed to a picture on the front 
page. “Isn’t this whose washing and ironing you deliver?” 

Liesel came over from the wall. She’d been writing the word 
argument six times, next to Max’s picture of the ropy cloud and the 
dripping sun. Max handed her the paper and she confirmed it. “That’s 
him.” 
When she went on to read the article, Heinz Hermann, the mayor, 
was quoted as saying that although the war was progressing 
splendidly, the people of Molching, like all responsible Germans, 
should take adequate measures and prepare for the possibility of 
harder times. “You never know,” he stated, “what our enemies are 
thinking, or how they will try to debilitate us.” 

A week later, the mayor’s words came to nasty fruition. Liesel, as 
she always did, showed up at Grande Strasse and read from The 
Whistler on the floor of the mayor’s library. The mayor’s wife showed 
no signs of abnormality (or, let’s be frank, no additional signs) until it 
was time to leave. 

This time, when she offered Liesel The Whistler, she insisted on the 
girl taking it. “Please.” She almost begged. The book was held out in a 
tight, measured fist. “Take it. Please, take it.” 

Liesel, touched by the strangeness of this woman, couldn’t bear to 
disappoint her again. The gray-covered book with its yellowing pages 
found its way into her hand and she began to walk the corridor. As 
she was about to ask for the washing, the mayor’s wife gave her a 
final look of bathrobed sorrow. She reached into the chest of drawers 
and withdrew an envelope. Her voice, lumpy from lack of use, 
coughed out the words. “I’m sorry. It’s for your mama.” 

Liesel stopped breathing. 
She was suddenly aware of how empty her feet felt inside her 

shoes. Something ridiculed her throat. She trembled. When finally she 
reached out and took possession of the letter, she noticed the sound of 
the clock in the library. Grimly, she realized that clocks don’t make a 
sound that even remotely resembles ticking, tocking. It was more the 
sound of a hammer, upside down, hacking methodically at the earth. 
It was the sound of a grave. If only mine was ready now, she thought 
—because Liesel Meminger, at that moment, wanted to die. When the 
others had canceled, it hadn’t hurt so much. There was always the 
mayor, his library, and her connection with his wife. Also, this was 
the last one, the last hope, gone. This time, it felt like the greatest 
betrayal. 

How could she face her mama? 

For Rosa, the few scraps of money had still helped in various 
alleyways. An extra handful of flour. A piece of fat. 

Ilsa Hermann was dying now herself—to get rid of her. Liesel could 
see it somewhere in the way she hugged the robe a little tighter. The 
clumsiness of sorrow still kept her at close proximity, but clearly, she 
wanted this to be over. “Tell your mama,” she spoke again. Her voice 
was adjusting now, as one sentence turned into two. “That we’re 
sorry.” She started shepherding the girl toward the door. 

Liesel felt it now in the shoulders. The pain, the impact of final 
rejection. 

That’s it? she asked internally. You just boot me out? 

Slowly, she picked up her empty bag and edged toward the door. 
Once outside, she turned and faced the mayor’s wife for the second to 
last time that day. She looked her in the eyes with an almost savage 
brand of pride. “Danke schon,” she said, and Ilsa Hermann smiled in a 
rather useless, beaten way. 

“If you ever want to come just to read,” the woman lied (or at least 
the girl, in her shocked, saddened state, perceived it as a lie), “you’re 
very welcome.” 

At that moment, Liesel was amazed by the width of the doorway. 
There was so much space. Why did people need so much space to get 

through the door? Had Rudy been there, he’d have called her an idiot 
—it was to get all their stuff inside. 

“Goodbye,” the girl said, and slowly, with great morosity, the door 
was Closed. 

Liesel did not leave. 

For a long time, she sat on the steps and watched Molching. It was 
neither warm nor cool and the town was clear and still. Molching was 
in a jar. 
She opened the letter. In it, Mayor Heinz Hermann diplomatically 
outlined exactly why he had to terminate the services of Rosa 
Hubermann. For the most part, he explained that he would be a 
hypocrite if he maintained his own small luxuries while advising 
others to prepare for harder times. 

When she eventually stood and walked home, her moment of 
reaction came once again when she saw the sTEINER-SCHNEIDER-MEISTER Sign 
on Munich Street. Her sadness left her and she was overwhelmed with 
anger. “That bastard mayor,” she whispered. “That pathetic woman.” 
The fact that harder times were coming was surely the best reason for 
keeping Rosa employed, but no, they fired her. At any rate, she 
decided, they could do their own blasted washing and ironing, like 
normal people. Like poor people. 
In her hand, The Whistler tightened. 
“So you give me the book,” the girl said, “for pity—to make 
yourself feel better ....” The fact that she’d also been offered the book 
prior to that day mattered little. 
She turned as she had once before and marched back to 8 Grande 

Strasse. The temptation to run was immense, but she refrained so that 
she’d have enough in reserve for the words. 

When she arrived, she was disappointed that the mayor himself was 
not there. No car was slotted nicely on the side of the road, which 
was perhaps a good thing. Had it been there, there was no telling 
what she might have done to it in this moment of rich versus poor. 

Two steps at a time, she reached the door and banged it hard 
enough to hurt. She enjoyed the small fragments of pain. 

Evidently, the mayor’s wife was shocked when she saw her again. 
Her fluffy hair was slightly wet and her wrinkles widened when she 
noticed the obvious fury on Liesel’s usually pallid face. She opened 
her mouth, but nothing came out, which was handy, really, for it was 
Liesel who possessed the talking. 

“You think,” she said, “you can buy me off with this book?” Her 
voice, though shaken, hooked at the woman’s throat. The glittering 
anger was thick and unnerving, but she toiled through it. She worked 
herself up even further, to the point where she needed to wipe the 
tears from her eyes. “You give me this Saumensch of a book and think 
itll make everything good when I go and tell my mama that we’ve 
just lost our last one? While you sit here in your mansion?” 

The mayor’s wife’s arms. 
They hung. 
Her face slipped. 

Liesel, however, did not buckle. She sprayed her words directly into 
the woman’s eyes. 
“You and your husband. Sitting up here.” Now she became spiteful. 
More spiteful and evil than she thought herself capable. 
The injury of words. 
Yes, the brutality of words. 
She summoned them from someplace she only now recognized and 
hurled them at Ilsa Hermann. “It’s about time,” she informed her, 
“that you do your own stinking washing anyway. It’s about time you 
faced the fact that your son is dead. He got killed! He got strangled 
and cut up more than twenty years ago! Or did he freeze to death? 

Either way, he’s dead! He’s dead and it’s pathetic that you sit here 
shivering in your own house to suffer for it. You think you’re the only 
one?” 

Immediately. 
Her brother was next to her. 

He whispered for her to stop, but he, too, was dead, and not worth 
listening to. 
He died in a train. 

They buried him in the snow. 

Liesel glanced at him, but she could not make herself stop. Not yet. 

“This book,” she went on. She shoved the boy down the steps, 
making him fall. “I don’t want it.” The words were quieter now, but 
still just as hot. She threw The Whistler at the woman’s slippered feet, 
hearing the clack of it as it landed on the cement. “I don’t want your 
miserable book ....” 

Now she managed it. She fell silent. 
Her throat was barren now. No words for miles. 
Her brother, holding his knee, disappeared. 

After a miscarriaged pause, the mayor’s wife edged forward and 
picked up the book. She was battered and beaten up, and not from 
smiling this time. Liesel could see it on her face. Blood leaked from 
her nose and licked at her lips. Her eyes had blackened. Cuts had 
opened up and a series of wounds were rising to the surface of her 
skin. All from the words. From Liesel’s words. 

Book in hand, and straightening from a crouch to a standing hunch, 
Ilsa Hermann began the process again of saying sorry, but the 
sentence did not make it out. 

Slap me, Liesel thought. Come on, slap me. 
Ilsa Hermann didn’t slap her. She merely retreated backward, into 

the ugly air of her beautiful house, and Liesel, once again, was left 
alone, clutching at the steps. She was afraid to turn around because 
she knew that when she did, the glass casing of Molching had now 
been shattered, and she’d be glad of it. 

As her last orders of business, she read the letter one more time, and 
when she was close to the gate, she screwed it up as tightly as she 
could and threw it at the door, as if it were a rock. I have no idea 
what the book thief expected, but the ball of paper hit the mighty 
sheet of wood and twittered back down the steps. It landed at her 
feet. 

“Typical,” she stated, kicking it onto the grass. “Useless.” 

On the way home this time, she imagined the fate of that paper the 
next time it rained, when the mended glass house of Molching was 
turned upside down. She could already see the words dissolving letter 
by letter, till there was nothing left. Just paper. Just earth. 

At home, as luck would have it, when Liesel walked through the door, 
Rosa was in the kitchen. “And?” she asked. “Where’s the washing?” 

“No washing today,” Liesel told her. 

Rosa came and sat down at the kitchen table. She knew. Suddenly, 
she appeared much older. Liesel imagined what she’d look like if she 
untied her bun, to let it fall out onto her shoulders. A gray towel of 
elastic hair. 

“What did you do there, you little Saumensch?” The sentence was 
numb. She could not muster her usual venom. 

“It was my fault,” Liesel answered. “Completely. I insulted the 
mayor’s wife and told her to stop crying over her dead son. I called 
her pathetic. That was when they fired you. Here.” She walked to the 
wooden spoons, grabbed a handful, and placed them in front of her. 
“Take your pick.” 

Rosa touched one and picked it up, but she did not wield it. “I don’t 

believe you.” 

Liesel was torn between distress and total mystification. The one 
time she desperately wanted a Watschen and she couldn’t get one! 
“Tt’s my fault.” 

“It’s not your fault,” Mama said, and she even stood and stroked 
Liesel’s waxy, unwashed hair. “I know you wouldn’t say those things.” 

“T said them!” 
“All right, you said them.” 

As Liesel left the room, she could hear the wooden spoons clicking 
back into position in the metal jar that held them. By the time she 
reached her bedroom, the whole lot of them, the jar included, were 
thrown to the floor. 

Later, she walked down to the basement, where Max was standing in 
the dark, most likely boxing with the Fuhrer. 

“Max?” The light dimmed on—a red coin, floating in the corner. 
“Can you teach me how to do the push-ups?” 

Max showed her and occasionally lifted her torso to help, but 
despite her bony appearance, Liesel was strong and could hold her 
body weight nicely. She didn’t count how many she could do, but that 
night, in the glow of the basement, the book thief completed enough 
pushups to make her hurt for several days. Even when Max advised 
her that she’d already done too many, she continued. 

In bed, she read with Papa, who could tell something was wrong. It 
was the first time in a month that he’d come in and sat with her, and 
she was comforted, if only slightly. Somehow, Hans Hubermann 
always knew what to say, when to stay, and when to leave her be. 
Perhaps Liesel was the one thing he was a true expert at. 

“Ts it the washing?” he asked. 
Liesel shook her head. 

Papa hadn’t shaved for a few days and he rubbed the scratchy 
whiskers every two or three minutes. His silver eyes were flat and 
calm, slightly warm, as they always were when it came to Liesel. 

When the reading petered out, Papa fell asleep. It was then that 
Liesel spoke what she’d wanted to say all along. 

“Papa,” she whispered, “I think I’m going to hell.” 
Her legs were warm. Her knees were cold. 

She remembered the nights when she’d wet the bed and Papa had 
washed the sheets and taught her the letters of the alphabet. Now his 
breathing blew across the blanket and she kissed his scratchy cheek. 
“You need a shave,” she said. 
“Youre not going to hell,” Papa replied. 
For a few moments, she watched his face. Then she lay back down, 
leaned on him, and together, they slept, very much in Munich, but 
somewhere on the seventh side of Germany’s die. 

RUDY’S YOUTH 

In the end, she had to give it to him. 
He knew how to perform. 

e e «A PORTRAIT OF RUDY STEINER: « « « 
JULY 1941 
Strings of mud clench his face. His tie 
is a pendulum, long dead in its clock. 
His lemon, lamp-lit hair is disheveled 
and he wears a sad, absurd smile. 

He stood a few meters from the step and spoke with great conviction, 
great joy. 
“Alles ist Scheisse,” he announced. 
All is shit. 

In the first half of 1941, while Liesel went about the business of 
concealing Max Vandenburg, stealing newspapers, and telling off 
mayors’ wives, Rudy was enduring a new life of his own, at the Hitler 
Youth. Since early February, he’d been returning from the meetings in 
a considerably worse state than he’d left in. On many of those return 
trips, Tommy Muller was by his side, in the same condition. The 
trouble had three elements to it. 

e « eA TRIPLE-TIERED PROBLEM « « « 
1. Tommy Muller’s ears. 

2. Franz Deutscher—the irate Hitler Youth leader. 

3. Rudy’s inability to stay out of things. 

If only Tommy Muller hadn’t disappeared for seven hours on one of 
the coldest days in Munich’s history, six years earlier. His ear 
infections and nerve damage were still contorting the marching 
pattern at the Hitler Youth, which, I can assure you, was not a 
positive thing. 
To begin with, the downward slide of momentum was gradual, but 
as the months progressed, Tommy was consistently gathering the ire 
of the Hitler Youth leaders, especially when it came to the marching. 
Remember Hitler’s birthday the previous year? For some time, the ear 
infections were getting worse. They had reached the point where 
Tommy had genuine problems hearing. He could not make out the 
commands that were shouted at the group as they marched in line. It 
didn’t matter if it was in the hall or outside, in the snow or the mud 
or the slits of rain. 

The goal was always to have everyone stop at the same time. 

“One click!” they were told. “That’s all the Führer wants to hear. 
Everyone united. Everyone together as one!” 

Then Tommy. 

It was his left ear, I think. That was the most troublesome of the 
two, and when the bitter cry of “Halt!” wet the ears of everybody 
else, Tommy marched comically and obliviously on. He could 
transform a marching line into a dog’s breakfast in the blink of an 
eye. 
On one particular Saturday, at the beginning of July, just after 
three-thirty and a litany of Tommy-inspired failed marching attempts, 
Franz Deutscher (the ultimate name for the ultimate teenage Nazi) 
was completely fed up. 

“Muller, du Affe!” His thick blond hair massaged his head and his 
words manipulated Tommy’s face. “You ape—what’s wrong with 
you?” 
Tommy slouched fearfully back, but his left cheek still managed to 

twitch in a manic, cheerful contortion. He appeared not only to be 
laughing with a triumphant smirk, but accepting the bucketing with 
glee. And Franz Deutscher wasn’t having any of it. His pale eyes 
cooked him. 

“Well?” he asked. “What can you say for yourself?” 
Tommy’s twitch only increased, in both speed and depth. 
“Are you mocking me?” 

“Heil,” twitched Tommy, in a desperate attempt to buy some 
approval, but he did not make it to the “Hitler” part. 

That was when Rudy stepped forward. He faced Franz Deutscher, 
looking up at him. “He’s got a problem, sir—” 
“T can see that!” 
“With his ears,” Rudy finished. “He can’t—” 

“Right, that’s it.” Deutscher rubbed his hands together. “Both of 
you—six laps of the grounds.” They obeyed, but not fast enough. 
“Schnell!” His voice chased them. 

When the six laps were completed, they were given some drills of 
the run-drop down-get up-get down again variety, and after fifteen 
very long minutes, they were ordered to the ground for what should 
have been the last time. 

Rudy looked down. 
A warped circle of mud grinned up at him. 
What might you be looking at? it seemed to ask. 
“Down!” Franz ordered. 
Rudy naturally jumped over it and dropped to his stomach. 
“Up!” Franz smiled. “One step back.” They did it. “Down!” 

The message was clear and now, Rudy accepted it. He dived at the 
mud and held his breath, and at that moment, lying ear to sodden 
earth, the drill ended. 

“Vielen Dank, meine Herren,” Franz Deutscher politely said. “Many 
thanks, my gentlemen.” 

Rudy climbed to his knees, did some gardening in his ear, and 
looked across at Tommy. 

Tommy closed his eyes, and he twitched. 

When they returned to Himmel Street that day, Liesel was playing 
hopscotch with some of the younger kids, still in her BDM uniform. 
From the corner of her eye, she saw the two melancholic figures 
walking toward her. One of them called out. 

They met on the front step of the Steiners’ concrete shoe box of a 
house, and Rudy told her all about the day’s episode. 
After ten minutes, Liesel sat down. 
After eleven minutes, Tommy, who was sitting next to her, said, 
“Tt’s all my fault,” but Rudy waved him away, somewhere between 
sentence and smile, chopping a mud streak in half with his finger. 
“Its my—” Tommy tried again, but Rudy broke the sentence 
completely and pointed at him. 

“Tommy, please.” There was a peculiar look of contentment on 
Rudy’s face. Liesel had never seen someone so miserable yet so 
wholeheartedly alive. “Just sit there and—twitch—or something,” 
and he continued with the story. 

He paced. 
He wrestled his tie. 

The words were flung at her, landing somewhere on the concrete 
step. 

“That Deutscher,” he summed up buoyantly. “He got us, huh, 
Tommy?” 

Tommy nodded, twitched, and spoke, not necessarily in that order. 
“Tt was because of me.” 

“Tommy, what did I say?” 
“When?” 
“Now! Just keep quiet.” 

“Sure, Rudy.” 

When Tommy walked forlornly home a short while later, Rudy tried 
what appeared to be a masterful new tactic. 

Pity. 
On the step, he perused the mud that had dried as a crusty sheet on 

his uniform, then looked Liesel hopelessly in the face. “What about it, 
Saumensch?” 

“What about what?” 
“You know ....” 
Liesel responded in the usual fashion. 

“Saukerl,” she laughed, and she walked the short distance home. A 
disconcerting mixture of mud and pity was one thing, but kissing 
Rudy Steiner was something entirely different. 

Smiling sadly on the step, he called out, rummaging a hand 
through his hair. “One day,” he warned her. “One day, Liesel!” 

In the basement, just over two years later, Liesel ached sometimes to 
go next door and see him, even if she was writing in the early hours 
of morning. She also realized it was most likely those sodden days at 
the Hitler Youth that had fed his, and subsequently her own, desire 
for crime. 
After all, despite the usual bouts of rain, summer was beginning to 
arrive properly. The Klar apples should have been ripening. There 
was more stealing to be done. 

THE LOSERS 

When it came to stealing, Liesel and Rudy first stuck with the idea 
that there was safety in numbers. Andy Schmeikl invited them to the 
river for a meeting. Among other things, a game plan for fruit stealing 
would be on the agenda. 

“So are you the leader now?” Rudy had asked, but Andy shook his 
head, heavy with disappointment. He clearly wished that he had what 
it took. 

“No.” His cool voice was unusually warm. Half-baked. “There’s 
someone else.” 

s e e THE NEW ARTHUR BERG « « « 
He had windy hair and cloudy eyes, 
and he was the kind of delinquent 
who had no other reason to 
steal except that he enjoyed it. 
His name was Viktor Chemmel. 

Unlike most people engaged in the various arts of thievery, Viktor 
Chemmel had it all. He lived in the best part of Molching, high up in 
a villa that had been fumigated when the Jews were driven out. He 
had money. He had cigarettes. What he wanted, however, was more. 

“No crime in wanting a little more,” he claimed, lying back in the 
grass with a collection of boys assembled around him. “Wanting more 
is our fundamental right as Germans. What does our Führer say?” He 
answered his own rhetoric. “We must take what is rightfully ours!” 

At face value, Viktor Chemmel was clearly your typical teenage 
bullshit artist. Unfortunately, when he felt like revealing it, he also 

possessed a certain charisma, a kind of follow me. 

When Liesel and Rudy approached the group by the river, she 
heard him ask another question. “So where are these two deviants 
you've been bragging about? It’s ten past four already.” 

“Not by my watch,” said Rudy. 

Viktor Chemmel propped himself up on an elbow. “You’re not 
wearing a watch.” 

“Would I be here if I was rich enough to own a watch?” 

The new leader sat up fully and smiled, with straight white teeth. 
He then turned his casual focus onto the girl. “Who’s the little 
whore?” Liesel, well accustomed to verbal abuse, simply watched the 
fog-ridden texture of his eyes. 

? 

“Last year,” she listed, “I stole at least three hundred apples and 
dozens of potatoes. I have little trouble with barbed wire fences and I 
can keep up with anyone here.” 

“Is that right?” 

“Yes.” She did not shrink or step away. “All I ask is a small part of 
anything we take. A dozen apples here or there. A few leftovers for 
me and my friend.” 

“Well, I suppose that can be arranged.” Viktor lit a cigarette and 
raised it to his mouth. He made a concerted effort to blow his next 
mouthful in Liesel’s face. 

Liesel did not cough. 

It was the same group as the previous year, the only exception being 
the leader. Liesel wondered why none of the other boys had assumed 
the helm, but looking from face to face, she realized that none of 
them had it. They had no qualms about stealing, but they needed to 
be told. They liked to be told, and Viktor Chemmel liked to be the 
teller. It was a nice microcosm. 

For a moment, Liesel longed for the reappearance of Arthur Berg. 
Or would he, too, have fallen under the leadership of Chemmel? It 

didn’t matter. Liesel only knew that Arthur Berg did not have a 
tyrannical bone in his body, whereas the new leader had hundreds of 
them. Last year, she knew that if she was stuck in a tree, Arthur 
would come back for her, despite claiming otherwise. This year, by 
comparison, she was instantly aware that Viktor Chemmel wouldn’t 
even bother to look back. 

He stood, regarding the lanky boy and the malnourished-looking 
girl. “So you want to steal with me?” 

What did they have to lose? They nodded. 
He stepped closer and grabbed Rudy’s hair. “I want to hear it.” 
“Definitely,” Rudy said, before being shoved back, fringe first. 
“And you?” 
“Of course.” Liesel was quick enough to avoid the same treatment. 
Viktor smiled. He squashed his cigarette, breathed deeply in, and 
scratched his chest. “My gentlemen, my whore, it looks like it’s time 
to go shopping.” 
As the group walked off, Liesel and Rudy were at the back, as 
they’d always been in the past. 
“Do you like him?” Rudy whispered. 
“Do you?” 
Rudy paused a moment. “I think he’s a complete bastard.” 
“Me too.” 
The group was getting away from them. 
“Come on,” Rudy said, “we’ve fallen behind.” 

After a few miles, they reached the first farm. What greeted them was 
a shock. The trees they’d imagined to be swollen with fruit were frail 
and injured-looking, with only a small array of apples hanging 
miserly from each branch. The next farm was the same. Maybe it was 
a bad season, or their timing wasn’t quite right. 

By the end of the afternoon, when the spoils were handed out, 

Liesel and Rudy were given one diminutive apple between them. In 
fairness, the takings were incredibly poor, but Viktor Chemmel also 
ran a tighter ship. 

“What do you call this?” Rudy asked, the apple resting in his palm. 

Viktor didn’t even turn around. “What does it look like?” The 
words were dropped over his shoulder. 

“One lousy apple?” 
“Here.” A half-eaten one was also tossed their way, landing 
chewed-side-down in the dirt. “You can have that one, too.” 
Rudy was incensed. “To hell with this. We didn’t walk ten miles for 
one and a half scrawny apples, did we, Liesel?” 
Liesel did not answer. 
She did not have time, for Viktor Chemmel was on top of Rudy 
before she could utter a word. His knees had pinned Rudy’s arms and 
his hands were around his throat. The apples were scooped up by 
none other than Andy Schmeikl, at Viktor’s request. 
“You’re hurting him,” Liesel said. 
“Am I?” Viktor was smiling again. She hated that smile. 
“He’s not hurting me.” Rudy’s words were rushed together and his 
face was red with strain. His nose began to bleed. 
After an extended moment or two of increased pressure, Viktor let 
Rudy go and climbed off him, taking a few careless steps. He said, 
“Get up, boy,” and Rudy, choosing wisely, did as he was told. 
Viktor came casually closer again and faced him. He gave him a 
gentle rub on the arm. A whisper. “Unless you want me to turn that 
blood into a fountain, I suggest you go away, little boy.” He looked at 
Liesel. “And take the little slut with you.” 
No one moved. 
“Well, what are you waiting for?” 

Liesel took Rudy’s hand and they left, but not before Rudy turned 
one last time and spat some blood and saliva at Viktor Chemmel’s 

feet. It evoked one final remark. 

s e eA SMALL THREAT FROM « « « 
VIKTOR CHEMMEL TO RUDY STEINER 
“You'll pay for that at a later date, my friend.” 

Say what you will about Viktor Chemmel, but he certainly had 
patience and a good memory. It took him approximately five months 
to turn his statement into a true one. 

SKETCHES 

If the summer of 1941 was walling up around the likes of Rudy and 
Liesel, it was writing and painting itself into the life of Max 
Vandenburg. In his loneliest moments in the basement, the words 
started piling up around him. The visions began to pour and fall and 
occasionally limp from out of his hands. 

He had what he called just a small ration of tools: 
A painted book. 
A handful of pencils. 
A mindful of thoughts. 
Like a simple puzzle, he put them together. 

Originally, Max had intended to write his own story. 

The idea was to write about everything that had happened to him 
—all that had led him to a Himmel Street basement—but it was not 
what came out. Max’s exile produced something else entirely. It was a 
collection of random thoughts and he chose to embrace them. They 
felt true. They were more real than the letters he wrote to his family 
and to his friend Walter Kugler, knowing very well that he could 
never send them. The desecrated pages of Mein Kampf were becoming 
a series of sketches, page after page, which to him summed up the 
events that had swapped his former life for another. Some took 
minutes. Others hours. He resolved that when the book was finished, 
he’d give it to Liesel, when she was old enough, and hopefully, when 
all this nonsense was over. 
From the moment he tested the pencils on the first painted page, he 
kept the book close at all times. Often, it was next to him or still in 
his fingers as he slept. 

One afternoon, after his push-ups and sit-ups, he fell asleep against 
the basement wall. When Liesel came down, she found the book 
sitting next to him, slanted against his thigh, and curiosity got the 
better of her. She leaned over and picked it up, waiting for him to 
stir. He didn’t. Max was sitting with his head and shoulder blades 
against the wall. She could barely make out the sound of his breath, 
coasting in and out of him, as she opened the book and glimpsed a 
few random pages ....

Frightened by what she saw, Liesel placed the book back down, 
exactly as she found it, against Max’s leg. 
A voice startled her. 
“Danke schon,” it said, and when she looked across, following the 

trail of sound to its owner, a small sign of satisfaction was present on 
his Jewish lips. 

“Holy Christ,” Liesel gasped. “You scared me, Max.” 

He returned to his sleep, and behind her, the girl dragged the same 
thought up the steps. 

You scared me, Max. 

THE WHISTLER AND THE SHOES 

The same pattern continued through the end of summer and well into 
autumn. Rudy did his best to survive the Hitler Youth. Max did his 
push-ups and made his sketches. Liesel found newspapers and wrote 
her words on the basement wall. 

It’s also worthy of mention that every pattern has at least one small 
bias, and one day it will tip itself over, or fall from one page to 
another. In this case, the dominant factor was Rudy. Or at least, Rudy 
and a freshly fertilized sports field. 

Late in October, all appeared to be usual. A filthy boy was walking 
down Himmel Street. Within a few minutes, his family would expect 
his arrival, and he would lie that everyone in his Hitler Youth 
division was given extra drills in the field. His parents would even 
expect some laughter. They didn’t get it. 

Today Rudy was all out of laughter and lies. 

On this particular Wednesday, when Liesel looked more closely, she 
could see that Rudy Steiner was shirtless. And he was furious. 

“What happened?” she asked as he trudged past. 
He reversed back and held out the shirt. “Smell it,” he said. 
“What?” 
“Are you deaf? I said smell it.” 

Reluctantly, Liesel leaned in and caught a ghastly whiff of the 
brown garment. “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Is that—?” 

The boy nodded. “It’s on my chin, too. My chin! I’m lucky I didn’t 
swallow it!” 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” 
“The field at Hitler Youth just got fertilized.” He gave his shirt 

another halfhearted, disgusted appraisal. “It’s cow manure, I think.” 
“Did what’s-his-name—Deutscher—know it was there?” 
“He says he didn’t. But he was grinning.” 
“Jesus, Mary, and—” 
“Could you stop saying that?!” 

What Rudy needed at this point in time was a victory. He had lost in 
his dealings with Viktor Chemmel. He’d endured problem after 
problem at the Hitler Youth. All he wanted was a small scrap of 
triumph, and he was determined to get it. 

He continued home, but when he reached the concrete step, he 
changed his mind and came slowly, purposefully back to the girl. 

Careful and quiet, he spoke. “You know what would cheer me up?” 
Liesel cringed. “If you think I’m going to—in that state ...” 

He seemed disappointed in her. “No, not that.” He sighed and 
stepped closer. “Something else.” After a moment’s thought, he raised 
his head, just a touch. “Look at me. I’m filthy. I stink like cow shit, or 
dog shit, whatever your opinion, and as usual, I’m absolutely 
starving.” He paused. “I need a win, Liesel. Honestly.” 

Liesel knew. 
She’d have gone closer but for the smell of him. 
Stealing. 
They had to steal something. 
No. 

They had to steal something back. It didn’t matter what. It needed 
only to be soon. 

“Just you and me this time,” Rudy suggested. “No Chemmels, no 
Schmeikls. Just you and me.” 

The girl couldn’t help it. 
Her hands itched, her pulse split, and her mouth smiled all at the 

same time. “Sounds good.” 

“It’s agreed, then,” and although he tried not to, Rudy could not 
hide the fertilized grin that grew on his face. “Tomorrow?” 

Liesel nodded. “Tomorrow.” 

Their plan was perfect but for one thing: 
They had no idea where to start. 

Fruit was out. Rudy snubbed his nose at onions and potatoes, and 
they drew the line at another attempt on Otto Sturm and his bikeful 
of farm produce. Once was immoral. Twice was complete bastardry. 

“So where the hell do we go?” Rudy asked. 
“How should I know? This was your idea, wasn’t it?” 
“That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think a little, too. I can’t think of 
everything.” 
“You can barely think of anything. ...” 

They argued on as they walked through town. On the outskirts, 
they witnessed the first of the farms and the trees standing like 
emaciated statues. The branches were gray and when they looked up 
at them, there was nothing but ragged limbs and empty sky. 

Rudy spat. 

They walked back through Molching, making suggestions. 
“What about Frau Diller?” 
“What about her?” 
“Maybe if we say ‘heil Hitler’ and then steal something, we'll be all 
right.” 

After roaming Munich Street for an hour or so, the daylight was 
drawing to a close and they were on the verge of giving up. “It’s 
pointless,” Rudy said, “and I’m even hungrier now than I’ve ever 
been. I’m starving, for Christ’s sake.” He walked another dozen steps 

before he stopped and looked back. “What’s with you?” because now 
Liesel was standing completely still, and a moment of realization was 
strapped to her face. 

Why hadn’t she thought of it before? 

“What is it?” Rudy was becoming impatient. “Saumensch, what’s 
going on?” 
At that very moment, Liesel was presented with a decision. Could 
she truly carry out what she was thinking? Could she really seek 
revenge on a person like this? Could she despise someone this much? 

She began walking in the opposite direction. When Rudy caught up, 
she slowed a little in the vain hope of achieving a little more clarity. 
After all, the guilt was already there. It was moist. The seed was 
already bursting into a dark-leafed flower. She weighed up whether 
she could really go through with this. At a crossroad, she stopped. 

“T know a place.” 

They went over the river and made their way up the hill. 

On Grande Strasse, they took in the splendor of the houses. The 
front doors glowed with polish, and the roof tiles sat like toupees, 
combed to perfection. The walls and windows were manicured and 
the chimneys almost breathed out smoke rings. 
Rudy planted his feet. “The mayor’s house?” 
Liesel nodded, seriously. A pause. “They fired my mama.” 
When they angled toward it, Rudy asked just how in God’s name 
they were going to get inside, but Liesel knew. “Local knowledge,” 
she answered. “Local—” But when they were able to see the window 

to the library at the far end of the house, she was greeted with a 
shock. The window was closed. 

“Well?” Rudy asked. 

Liesel swiveled slowly and hurried off. “Not today,” she said. Rudy 
laughed. 

“T knew it.” He caught up. “I knew it, you filthy Saumensch. You 
couldn’t get in there even if you had the key.” 

“Do you mind?” She quickened even more and brushed aside 
Rudy’s commentary. “We just have to wait for the right opportunity.” 
Internally, she shrugged away from a kind of gladness that the 
window was closed. She berated herself. Why, Liesel? she asked. Why 
did you have to explode when they fired Mama? Why couldn’t you 
just keep your big mouth shut? For all you know, the mayor’s wife is 
now completely reformed after you yelled and screamed at her. 
Maybe she’s straightened herself out, picked herself up. Maybe she'll 
never let herself shiver in that house again and the window will be 
shut forever.... You stupid Saumensch! 

A week later, however, on their fifth visit to the upper part of 
Molching, it was there. 

The open window breathed a slice of air in. 
That was all it would take. 

It was Rudy who stopped first. He tapped Liesel in the ribs, with the 
back of his hand. “Is that window,” he whispered, “open?” The 
eagerness in his voice leaned from his mouth, like a forearm onto 
Liesel’s shoulder. 
“Jawohl,” she answered. “It sure is.” 

And how her heart began to heat. 

On each previous occasion, when they found the window clamped 
firmly shut, Liesel’s outer disappointment had masked a ferocious 
relief. Would she have had the neck to go in? And who and what, in 
fact, was she going in for? For Rudy? To locate some food? 

No, the repugnant truth was this: 

She didn’t care about the food. Rudy, no matter how hard she tried 
to resist the idea, was secondary to her plan. It was the book she 
wanted. The Whistler. She wouldn’t tolerate having it given to her by 
a lonely, pathetic old woman. Stealing it, on the other hand, seemed a 
little more acceptable. Stealing it, in a sick kind of sense, was like 
earning it. 

The light was changing in blocks of shade. 

The pair of them gravitated toward the immaculate, bulky house. 
They rustled their thoughts. 

“You hungry?” Rudy asked. 
Liesel replied. “Starving.” For a book. 
“Look—a light just came on upstairs.” 
“T see it.” 
“Still hungry, Saumensch?” 

They laughed nervously for a moment before going through the 
motions of who should go in and who should stand watch. As the 
male in the operation, Rudy clearly felt that he should be the 
aggressor, but it was obvious that Liesel knew this place. It was she 
who was going in. She knew what was on the other side of the 
window. 

She said it. “It has to be me.” 

Liesel closed her eyes. Tightly. 

She compelled herself to remember, to see visions of the mayor and 
his wife. She watched her gathered friendship with Ilsa Hermann and 
made sure to see it kicked in the shins and left by the wayside. It 
worked. She detested them. 

They scouted the street and crossed the yard silently. 
Now they were crouched beneath the slit in the window on the 

ground floor. The sound of their breathing amplified. 
“Here,” Rudy said, “give me your shoes. You'll be quieter.” 

Without complaint, Liesel undid the worn black laces and left the 
shoes on the ground. She rose up and Rudy gently opened the 
window just wide enough for Liesel to climb through. The noise of it 
passed overhead, like a low-flying plane. 

Liesel heaved herself onto the ledge and tussled her way inside. 
Taking off her shoes, she realized, was a brilliant idea, as she landed 
much heavier on the wooden floor than she’d anticipated. The soles 
of her feet expanded in that painful way, rising to the inside edges of 
her socks. 
The room itself was as it always was. 
Liesel, in the dusty dimness, shrugged off her feelings of nostalgia. 
She crept forward and allowed her eyes to adjust. 
“What’s going on?” Rudy whispered sharply from outside, but she 
waved him a backhander that meant Halt’s Maul. Keep quiet. 
“The food,” he reminded her. “Find the food. And cigarettes, if you 
can.” 
Both items, however, were the last things on her mind. She was 
home, among the mayor’s books of every color and description, with 
their silver and gold lettering. She could smell the pages. She could 
almost taste the words as they stacked up around her. Her feet took 
her to the right-hand wall. She knew the one she wanted—the exact 
position—but when she made it to The Whistler’s usual place on the 
shelf, it was not there. A slight gap was in its place. 
From above, she heard footsteps. 
“The light!” Rudy whispered. The words were shoved through the 
open window. “It’s out!” 
“Scheisse. ” 
“They’re coming downstairs.” 
There was a giant length of a moment then, the eternity of split- 
second decision. Her eyes scanned the room and she could see The 

Whistler, sitting patiently on the mayor’s desk. 

“Hurry up,” Rudy warned her. But very calmly and cleanly, Liesel 
walked over, picked up the book, and made her way cautiously out. 
Headfirst, she climbed from the window, managing to land on her 
feet again, feeling the pang of pain once more, this time in her ankles. 

“Come on,” Rudy implored her. “Run, run. Schnell!” 

Once around the corner, on the road back down to the river and 
Munich Street, she stopped to bend over and recover. Her body was 
folded in the middle, the air half frozen in her mouth, her heart 
tolling in her ears. 

Rudy was the same. 

When he looked over, he saw the book under her arm. He struggled 
to speak. “What’s”—he grappled with the words—“with the book?” 

The darkness was filling up truly now. Liesel panted, the air in her 
throat defrosting. “It was all I could find.” 

Unfortunately, Rudy could smell it. The lie. He cocked his head and 
told her what he felt was a fact. “You didn’t go in for food, did you? 
You got what you wanted ....” 

Liesel straightened then and was overcome with the sickness of 
another realization. 

The shoes. 

She looked at Rudy’s feet, then at his hands, and at the ground all 
around him. 

“What?” he asked. “What is it?” 

“Saukerl,” she accused him. “Where are my shoes?” Rudy’s face 
whitened, which left her in no doubt. “They’re back at the house,” she 
suggested, “aren’t they?” 

Rudy searched desperately around himself, begging against all 
reality that he might have brought them with him. He imagined 
himself picking them up, wishing it true—but the shoes were not 
there. They sat uselessly, or actually, much worse, incriminatingly, by 
the wall at 8 Grande Strasse. 

“Dummkopf!” he admonished himself, smacking his ear. He looked 
down shamefully at the sullen sight of Liesel’s socks. “Idiot!” It didn’t 
take him long to decide on making it right. Earnestly, he said, “Just 
wait,” and he hurried back around the corner. 

“Don’t get caught,” Liesel called after him, but he didn’t hear. 

The minutes were heavy while he was gone. 

Darkness was now complete and Liesel was quite certain that a 
Watschen was most likely in the cards when she returned home. 
“Hurry,” she murmured, but still Rudy didn’t appear. She imagined 
the sound of a police siren throwing itself forward and reeling itself 
in. Collecting itself. 
Still, nothing. 
Only when she walked back to the intersection of the two streets in 
her damp, dirty socks did she see him. Rudy’s triumphant face was 
held nicely up as he trotted steadily toward her. His teeth were 
gnashed into a grin, and the shoes dangled from his hand. “They 
nearly killed me,” he said, “but I made it.” Once they’d crossed the 
river, he handed Liesel the shoes, and she threw them down. 

Sitting on the ground, she looked up at her best friend. “Danke,” 
she said. “Thank you.” 
Rudy bowed. “My pleasure.” He tried for a little more. “No point 
asking if I get a kiss for that, I guess?” 
“For bringing my shoes, which you left behind?” 
“Fair enough.” He held up his hands and continued speaking as 
they walked on, and Liesel made a concerted effort to ignore him. She 
only heard the last part. “Probably wouldn’t want to kiss you anyway 
—not if your breath’s anything like your shoes.” 
“You disgust me,” she informed him, and she hoped he couldn’t see 
the escaped beginnings of a smile that had fallen from her mouth. 

On Himmel Street, Rudy captured the book. Under a lamppost, he 

read out the title and wondered what it was about. 
Dreamily, Liesel answered. “Just a murderer.” 
“Ts that all?” 
“There’s also a policeman trying to catch him.” 
Rudy handed it back. “Speaking of which, I think we’re both 
slightly in for it when we get home. You especially.” 
“Why me?” 
“You know—your mama.” 
“What about her?” Liesel was exercising the blatant right of every 
person who’s ever belonged to a family. It’s all very well for such a 
person to whine and moan and criticize other family members, but 
they won’t let anyone else do it. That’s when you get your back up and 
show loyalty. “Is there something wrong with her?” 
Rudy backed away. “Sorry, Saumensch. I didn’t mean to offend 
you.” 
Even in the night, Liesel could see that Rudy was growing. His face 
was lengthening. The blond shock of hair was darkening ever so 
slightly and his features seemed to be changing shape. But there was 
one thing that would never change. It was impossible to be angry at 
him for long. 
“Anything good to eat at your place tonight?” he asked. 
“T doubt it.” 

“Me neither. It’s a shame you can’t eat books. Arthur Berg said 
something like that once. Remember?” 

They recounted the good old days for the remainder of the walk, 
Liesel often glancing down at The Whistler, at the gray cover and the 
black imprinted title. 

Before they went into their respective homes, Rudy stopped a 
moment and said, “Goodbye, Saumensch.” He laughed. “Good night, 
book thief.” 

It was the first time Liesel had been branded with her title, and she 
couldn’t hide the fact that she liked it very much. As we’re both 
aware, she’d stolen books previously, but in late October 1941, it 
became official. That night, Liesel Meminger truly became the book 
thief. 

THREE ACTS OF STUPIDITY BY RUDY STEINER 

e e e RUDY STEINER, PURE GENIUS « « « 
1. He stole the biggest potato from Mamer’s, the local grocer. 
2. Taking on Franz Deutscher on Munich Street. 

3. Skipping the Hitler Youth meetings altogether. 

The problem with Rudy’s first act was greed. It was a typically dreary 
afternoon in mid-November 1941. 

Earlier, he’d woven through the women with their coupons quite 
brilliantly, almost, dare I say it, with a touch of criminal genius. He 
nearly went completely unnoticed. 

Inconspicuous as he was, however, he managed to take hold of the 
biggest potato of the lot—the very same one that several people in 
the line had been watching. They all looked on as a thirteen-year-old 
fist rose up and grabbed it. A choir of heavyset Helgas pointed him 
out, and Thomas Mamer came storming toward the dirty fruit. 

“Meine Erddpfel,” he said. “My earth apples.” 

The potato was still in Rudy’s hands (he couldn’t hold it in just the 
one), and the women gathered around him like a troop of wrestlers. 
Some fast talking was required. 

“My family,” Rudy explained. A convenient stream of clear fluid 
began to trickle from his nose. He made a point of not wiping it away. 
“Were all starving. My sister needed a new coat. The last one was 
stolen.” 

Mamer was no fool. Still holding Rudy by the collar, he said, “And 
you plan to dress her with a potato?” 

“No, sir.” He looked diagonally into the one eye he could see of his 
captor. Mamer was a barrel of a man, with two small bullet holes to 
look out of. His teeth were like a soccer crowd, crammed in. “We 
traded all our points for the coat three weeks ago and now we have 
nothing to eat.” 

The grocer held Rudy in one hand and the potato in the other. He 
called out the dreaded word to his wife. “Polizei.” 

“No,” Rudy begged, “please.” He would tell Liesel later on that he 
was not the slightest bit afraid, but his heart was certainly bursting at 
that moment, I’m sure. “Not the police. Please, not the police.” 

“Polizei.” Mamer remained unmoved as the boy wriggled and 
fought with the air. 

Also in the line that afternoon was a teacher, Herr Link. He was in the 
percentage of teachers at school who were not priests or nuns. Rudy 
found him and accosted him in the eyes. 

“Herr Link.” This was his last chance. “Herr Link, tell him, please. 
Tell him how poor I am.” 

The grocer looked at the teacher with inquiring eyes. 

Herr Link stepped forward and said, “Yes, Herr Mamer. This boy is 
poor. He’s from Himmel Street.” The crowd of predominantly women 
conferred at that point, knowing that Himmel Street was not exactly 
the epitome of idyllic Molching living. It was well known as a 
relatively poor neighborhood. “He has eight brothers and sisters.” 

Eight! 
Rudy had to hold back a smile, though he wasn’t in the clear yet. 

At least he had the teacher lying now. He’d somehow managed to add 
three more children to the Steiner family. 

“Often, he comes to school without breakfast,” and the crowd of 
women was conferring again. It was like a coat of paint on the 
situation, adding a little extra potency and atmosphere. 

“So that means he should be allowed to steal my potatoes?” 

“The biggest one!” one of the women ejaculated. 

“Keep quiet, Frau Metzing,” Mamer warned her, and she quickly 
settled down. 

At first, all attention was on Rudy and the scruff of his neck. It then 
moved back and forth, from the boy to the potato to Mamer—from 
best-looking to worst—and exactly what made the grocer decide in 
Rudy’s favor would forever be unanswered. 

Was it the pathetic nature of the boy? 
The dignity of Herr Link? 
The annoyance of Frau Metzing? 

Whatever it was, Mamer dropped the potato back on the pile and 
dragged Rudy from his premises. He gave him a good push with his 
right boot and said, “Don’t come back.” 

From outside, Rudy looked on as Mamer reached the counter to 
serve his next customer with food and sarcasm. “I wonder which 
potato you’re going to ask for,” he said, keeping one eye open for the 
boy. 
For Rudy, it was yet another failure. 

The second act of stupidity was equally dangerous, but for different 
reasons. 

Rudy would finish this particular altercation with a black eye, 
cracked ribs, and a haircut. 
Again, at the Hitler Youth meetings, Tommy Muller was having his 
problems, and Franz Deutscher was just waiting for Rudy to step in. It 
didn’t take long. 
Rudy and Tommy were given another comprehensive drill session 
while the others went inside to learn tactics. As they ran in the cold, 

they could see the warm heads and shoulders through the windows. 
Even when they joined the rest of the group, the drills weren’t quite 
finished. As Rudy slumped into the corner and flicked mud from his 
sleeve at the window, Franz fired the Hitler Youth’s favorite question 
at him. 

“When was our Führer, Adolf Hitler, born?” 
Rudy looked up. “Sorry?” 

The question was repeated, and the very stupid Rudy Steiner, who 
knew all too well that it was April 20, 1889, answered with the birth 
of Christ. He even threw in Bethlehem as an added piece of 
information. 

Franz smeared his hands together. 
A very bad sign. 

He walked over to Rudy and ordered him back outside for some 
more laps of the field. 

Rudy ran them alone, and after every lap, he was asked again the 
date of the Führer’s birthday. He did seven laps before he got it right. 

The major trouble occurred a few days after the meeting. 

On Munich Street, Rudy noticed Deutscher walking along the 
footpath with some friends and felt the need to throw a rock at him. 
You might well ask just what the hell he was thinking. The answer is, 
probably nothing at all. He’d probably say that he was exercising his 
God-given right to stupidity. Either that, or the very sight of Franz 
Deutscher gave him the urge to destroy himself. 
The rock hit its mark on the spine, though not as hard as Rudy 
might have hoped. Franz Deutscher spun around and looked happy to 
find him standing there, with Liesel, Tommy, and Tommy’s little 
sister, Kristina. 
“Let’s run,” Liesel urged him, but Rudy didn’t move. 
“We’re not at Hitler Youth now,” he informed her. The older boys 
had already arrived. Liesel remained next to her friend, as did the 

twitching Tommy and the delicate Kristina. 

“Mr. Steiner,” Franz declared, before picking him up and throwing 
him to the pavement. 

When Rudy stood up, it served only to infuriate Deutscher even 
more. He brought him to the ground for a second time, following him 
down with a knee to the rib cage. 

Again, Rudy stood up, and the group of older boys laughed now at 
their friend. This was not the best news for Rudy. “Can’t you make 
him feel it?” the tallest of them said. His eyes were as blue and cold 
as the sky, and the words were all the incentive Franz needed. He was 
determined that Rudy would hit the ground and stay there. 

A larger crowd made its way around them as Rudy swung at Franz 
Deutscher’s stomach, missing him completely. Simultaneously, he felt 
the burning sensation of a fist on his left eye socket. It arrived with 
sparks, and he was on the ground before he even realized. He was 
punched again, in the same place, and he could feel the bruise turn 
yellow and blue and black all at once. Three layers of exhilarating 
pain. 
The developing crowd gathered and leered to see if Rudy might get 
up again. He didn’t. This time, he remained on the cold, wet ground, 
feeling it rise through his clothes and spread itself out. 

The sparks were still in his eyes, and he didn’t notice until it was 
too late that Franz now stood above him with a brand-new 
pocketknife, about to crouch down and cut him. 
“No!” Liesel protested, but the tall one held her back. In her ear, his 
words were deep and old. 
“Don’t worry,” he assured her. “He won’t do it. He doesn’t have the 
guts.” 

He was wrong. 

Franz merged into a kneeling position as he leaned closer to Rudy and 
whispered: 

“When was our Führer born?” Each word was carefully created and 
fed into his ear. “Come on, Rudy, when was he born? You can tell me, 
everything’s fine, don’t be afraid.” 

And Rudy? 
How did he reply? 

Did he respond prudently, or did he allow his stupidity to sink 
himself deeper into the mire? 

He looked happily into the pale blue eyes of Franz Deutscher and 
whispered, “Easter Monday.” 

Within a few seconds, the knife was applied to his hair. It was 
haircut number two in this section of Liesel’s life. The hair of a Jew 
was cut with rusty scissors. Her best friend was taken to with a 
gleaming knife. She knew nobody who actually paid for a haircut. 

As for Rudy, so far this year he’d swallowed mud, bathed himself in 
fertilizer, been half-strangled by a developing criminal, and was now 
receiving something at least nearing the icing on the cake—public 
humiliation on Munich Street. 

For the most part, his fringe was sliced away freely, but with each 
stroke, there were always a few hairs that held on for dear life and 
were pulled out completely. As each one was plucked, Rudy winced, 
his black eye throbbing in the process and his ribs flashing in pain. 

“April twentieth, eighteen eighty-nine!” Franz lectured him, and 
when he led his cohorts away, the audience dispersed, leaving only 
Liesel, Tommy, and Kristina with their friend. 

Rudy lay quietly on the ground, in the rising damp. 

Which leaves us only with stupid act number three—skipping the 
Hitler Youth meetings. 
He didn’t stop going right away, purely to show Deutscher that he 
wasn’t afraid of him, but after another few weeks, Rudy ceased his 
involvement altogether. 

Dressed proudly in his uniform, he exited Himmel Street and kept 

walking, his loyal subject, Tommy, by his side. 

Instead of attending the Hitler Youth, they walked out of town and 
along the Amper, skipping stones, heaving enormous rocks into the 
water, and generally getting up to no good. He made sure to get the 
uniform dirty enough to fool his mother, at least until the first letter 
arrived. That was when he heard the dreaded call from the kitchen. 

First, his parents threatened him. He didn’t attend. 
They begged him to go. He refused. 

Eventually, it was the opportunity to join a different division that 
swayed Rudy in the right direction. This was fortunate, because if he 
didn’t show his face soon, the Steiners would be fined for his non- 
attendance. His older brother, Kurt, inquired as to whether Rudy 
might join the Flieger Division, which specialized in the teaching of 
aircraft and flying. Mostly, they built model airplanes, and there was 
no Franz Deutscher. Rudy accepted, and Tommy also joined. It was 
the one time in his life that his idiotic behavior delivered beneficial 
results. 

In his new division, whenever he was asked the famous Fuhrer 
question, Rudy would smile and answer, “April 20, 1889,” and then 
to Tommy, he’d whisper a different date, like Beethoven’s birthday, or 
Mozart’s, or Strauss’s. They’d been learning about composers in 
school, where despite his obvious stupidity, Rudy excelled. 

THE FLOATING BOOK (Part IT) 

At the beginning of December, victory finally came to Rudy Steiner, 
though not in a typical fashion. 

It was a cold day, but very still. It had come close to snowing. 

After school, Rudy and Liesel stopped in at Alex Steiner’s shop, and 
as they walked home, they saw Rudy’s old friend Franz Deutscher 
coming around the corner. Liesel, as was her habit these days, was 
carrying The Whistler. She liked to feel it in her hand. Either the 
smooth spine or the rough edges of paper. It was she who saw him 
first. 

“Look.” She pointed. Deutscher was loping toward them with 
another Hitler Youth leader. 
Rudy shrank into himself. He felt at his mending eye. “Not this 
time.” He searched the streets. “If we go past the church, we can 
follow the river and cut back that way.” 
With no further words, Liesel followed him, and they successfully 
avoided Rudy’s tormentor—straight into the path of another. 

At first, they thought nothing of it. 

The group crossing the bridge and smoking cigarettes could have 
been anybody, and it was too late to turn around when the two 
parties recognized each other. 

“Oh, no, they’ve seen us.” 

Viktor Chemmel smiled. 
He spoke very amiably. This could only mean that he was at his 
most dangerous. “Well, well, if it isn’t Rudy Steiner and his little 
whore.” Very smoothly, he met them and snatched The Whistler from 

Liesel’s grip. “What are we reading?” 

“This is between us.” Rudy tried to reason with him. “It has nothing 
to do with her. Come on, give it back.” 

“The Whistler.” He addressed Liesel now. “Any good?” 

She cleared her throat. “Not bad.” Unfortunately, she gave herself 
away. In the eyes. They were agitated. She knew the exact moment 
when Viktor Chemmel established that the book was a prize 
possession. 

“Tl tell you what,” he said. “For fifty marks, you can have it back.” 

“Fifty marks!” That was Andy Schmeikl. “Come on, Viktor, you 
could buy a thousand books for that.” 

“Did I ask you to speak?” 
Andy kept quiet. His mouth seemed to swing shut. 
Liesel tried a poker face. “You can keep it, then. ’ve already read 
it.” 
“What happens at the end?” 
Damn it! 
She hadn’t gotten that far yet. 
She hesitated, and Viktor Chemmel deciphered it instantly. 

Rudy rushed at him now. “Come on, Viktor, don’t do this to her. It’s 
me you're after. lIl do anything you want.” 
The older boy only swatted him away, the book held aloft. And he 
corrected him. 

“No,” he said. “I’ll do anything I want,” and he proceeded to the 
river. Everyone followed, at catch-up speed. Half walk, half run. Some 
protested. Some urged him on. 

It was so quick, and relaxed. There was a question, and a mocking, 
friendly voice. 

“Tell me,” Viktor said. “Who was the last Olympic discus champion, 

in Berlin?” He turned to face them. He warmed up his arm. “Who was 
it? Goddamn it, it’s on the tip of my tongue. It was that American, 
wasn’t it? Carpenter or something ...” 

“Please!”—Rudy. 

The water toppled. 
Viktor Chemmel did the spin. 

The book was released gloriously from his hand. It opened and 
flapped, the pages rattling as it covered ground in the air. More 
abruptly than expected, it stopped and appeared to be sucked toward 
the water. It clapped when it hit the surface and began to float 
downstream. 

Viktor shook his head. “Not enough height. A poor throw.” He 
smiled again. “But still good enough to win, huh?” 

Liesel and Rudy didn’t stick around to hear the laughter. 

Rudy in particular had taken off down the riverbank, attempting to 
locate the book. 

“Can you see it?” Liesel called out. 
Rudy ran. 

He continued down the water’s edge, showing her the book’s location. 
“Over there!” He stopped and pointed and ran farther down to 
overtake it. Soon, he peeled off his coat and jumped in, wading to the 
middle of the river. 

Liesel, slowing to a walk, could see the ache of each step. The 
painful cold. 

When she was close enough, she saw it move past him, but he soon 
caught up. His hand reached in and collared what was now a soggy 
block of cardboard and paper. “The Whistler!” the boy called out. It 
was the only book floating down the Amper River that day, but he 
still felt the need to announce it. 

Another note of interest is that Rudy did not attempt to leave the 
devastatingly cold water as soon as he held the book in his hand. For 
a good minute or so, he stayed. He never did explain it to Liesel, but I 
think she knew very well that the reasons were twofold. 

s e ¢ THE FROZEN MOTIVES « « « 
OF RUDY STEINER 
1. After months of failure, this moment was his only chance to 
revel in some victory. 
2. Such a position of selflessness was a good place to ask Liesel 
for the usual favor. 
How could she possibly turn him down? 

“How about a kiss, Saumensch?” 

He stood waist-deep in the water for a few moments longer before 
climbing out and handing her the book. His pants clung to him, and 
he did not stop walking. In truth, I think he was afraid. Rudy Steiner 
was scared of the book thief’s kiss. He must have longed for it so 
much. He must have loved her so incredibly hard. So hard that he 
would never ask for her lips again and would go to his grave without 
them.

DEATH’S DIARY: 1942 

It was a year for the ages, like 79, like 1346, to name just a few. 
Forget the scythe, Goddamn it, I needed a broom or a mop. And I 
needed a vacation. 

e e eA SMALL PIECE OF TRUTH « « « 
I do not carry a sickle or scythe. 
I only wear a hooded black robe when it’s cold. 
And I don’t have those skull-like 
facial features you seem to enjoy 
pinning on me from a distance. You 
want to know what I truly look like? 
Pll help you out. Find yourself 
a mirror while I continue. 

I actually feel quite self-indulgent at the moment, telling you all 
about me, me, me. My travels, what I saw in ’42. On the other hand, 
you’re a human—you should understand self-obsession. The point is, 
there’s a reason for me explaining what I saw in that time. Much of it 
would have repercussions for Liesel Meminger. It brought the war 
closer to Himmel Street, and it dragged me along for the ride. 

There were certainly some rounds to be made that year, from Poland 
to Russia to Africa and back again. You might argue that I make the 
rounds no matter what year it is, but sometimes the human race likes 
to crank things up a little. They increase the production of bodies and 
their escaping souls. A few bombs usually do the trick. Or some gas 
chambers, or the chitchat of faraway guns. If none of that finishes 

proceedings, it at least strips people of their living arrangements, and 
I witness the homeless everywhere. They often come after me as I 
wander through the streets of molested cities. They beg me to take 
them with me, not realizing I’m too busy as it is. “Your time will 
come,” I convince them, and I try not to look back. At times, I wish I 
could say something like, “Don’t you see I’ve already got enough on 
my plate?” but I never do. I complain internally as I go about my 
work, and some years, the souls and bodies don’t add up; they 
multiply. 

s e e AN ABRIDGED ROLL CALL FOR 1942 « « « 
1. The desperate Jews—their spirits in my lap as we sat on the 
roof, next to the steaming chimneys. 
2. The Russian soldiers—taking only small amounts of 
ammunition, relying on the fallen for the rest of it. 
3. The soaked bodies of a French coast—beached on the shingle 

and sand. 

I could go on, but I’ve decided for now that three examples will 
suffice. Three examples, if nothing else, will give you the ashen taste 
in your mouth that defined my existence during that year. 

So many humans. 
So many colors. 

They keep triggering inside me. They harass my memory. I see them 
tall in their heaps, all mounted on top of each other. There is air like 
plastic, a horizon like setting glue. There are skies manufactured by 

people, punctured and leaking, and there are soft, coal-colored 
clouds, beating like black hearts. 

And then. 
There is death. 
Making his way through all of it. 
On the surface: unflappable, unwavering. 
Below: unnerved, untied, and undone. 

In all honesty (and I know I’m complaining excessively now), I was 
still getting over Stalin, in Russia. The so-called second revolution—the 
murder of his own people. 

Then came Hitler. 

They say that war is death’s best friend, but I must offer you a 
different point of view on that one. To me, war is like the new boss 
who expects the impossible. He stands over your shoulder repeating 
one thing, incessantly: “Get it done, get it done.” So you work harder. 
You get the job done. The boss, however, does not thank you. He asks 
for more. 

Often, I try to remember the strewn pieces of beauty I saw in that 
time as well. I plow through my library of stories. 

In fact, I reach for one now. 

I believe you know half of it already, and if you come with me, PI 
show you the rest. I’ll show you the second half of a book thief. 

Unknowingly, she awaits a great many things that I alluded to just 
a minute ago, but she also waits for you. 

She’s carrying some snow down to a basement, of all places. 

Handfuls of frosty water can make almost anyone smile, but it 
cannot make them forget. 

Here she comes. 

THE SNOWMAN 

For Liesel Meminger, the early stages of 1942 could be summed up 
like this: 

She became thirteen years of age. Her chest was still flat. She had 
not yet bled. The young man from her basement was now in her bed. 

ses Q&As», 
How did Max 
Vandenburg end up 
in Liesel’s bed? 
He fell. 

Opinions varied, but Rosa Hubermann claimed that the seeds were 
sown at Christmas the previous year. 

December 24 had been hungry and cold, but there was a major 
bonus—no lengthy visitations. Hans Junior was simultaneously 
shooting at Russians and maintaining his strike on family interaction. 
Trudy could only stop by on the weekend before Christmas, for a few 
hours. She was going away with her family of employment. A holiday 
for a very different class of Germany. 

On Christmas Eve, Liesel brought down a double handful of snow 
as a present for Max. “Close your eyes,” she’d said. “Hold out your 
hands.” As soon as the snow was transferred, Max shivered and 
laughed, but he still didn’t open his eyes. He only gave the snow a 
quick taste, allowing it to sink into his lips. 
“Ts this today’s weather report?” 
Liesel stood next to him. 

Gently, she touched his arm. 

He raised it again to his mouth. “Thanks, Liesel.” 

It was the beginning of the greatest Christmas ever. Little food. No 
presents. But there was a snowman in their basement. 

After delivering the first handfuls of snow, Liesel checked that no one 
else was outside, then proceeded to take as many buckets and pots 
out as she could. She filled them with the mounds of snow and ice 
that blanketed the small strip of world that was Himmel Street. Once 
they were full, she brought them in and carried them down to the 
basement. 

All things being fair, she first threw a snowball at Max and 
collected a reply in the stomach. Max even threw one at Hans 
Hubermann as he made his way down the basement steps. 

“Arschloch!” Papa yelped. “Liesel, give me some of that snow. A 
whole bucket!” For a few minutes, they all forgot. There was no more 
yelling or calling out, but they could not contain the small snatches of 
laughter. They were only humans, playing in the snow, in a house. 

Papa looked at the snow-filled pots. “What do we do with the rest 
of it?” 
“A snowman,” Liesel replied. “We have to make a snowman.” 
Papa called out to Rosa. 
The usual distant voice was hurled back. “What is it now, Saukerl?” 
“Come down here, will you!” 

When his wife appeared, Hans Hubermann risked his life by 
throwing a most excellent snowball at her. Just missing, it 
disintegrated when it hit the wall, and Mama had an excuse to swear 
for a long time without taking a breath. Once she recovered, she came 
down and helped them. She even brought the buttons for the eyes and 
nose and some string for a snowman smile. Even a scarf and hat were 
provided for what was really only a two-foot man of snow. 

“A midget,” Max had said. 
“What do we do when it melts?” Liesel asked. 

Rosa had the answer. “You mop it up, Saumensch, in a hurry.” 

Papa disagreed. “It won’t melt.” He rubbed his hands and blew into 
them. “It’s freezing down here.” 

Melt it did, though, but somewhere in each of them, that snowman 
was still upright. It must have been the last thing they saw that 
Christmas Eve when they finally fell asleep. There was an accordion 
in their ears, a snowman in their eyes, and for Liesel, there was the 
thought of Max’s last words before she left him by the fire. 

e e e CHRISTMAS GREETINGS FROM « « « 
MAX VANDENBURG 
“Often I wish this would all be over, Liesel, but then somehow 
you do something like walk down the basement steps with a 
snowman in your hands.” 

Unfortunately, that night signaled a severe downslide in Max’s health. 
The early signs were innocent enough, and typical. Constant coldness. 
Swimming hands. Increased visions of boxing with the Führer. It was 
only when he couldn’t warm up after his push-ups and sit-ups that it 
truly began to worry him. As close to the fire as he sat, he could not 
raise himself to any degree of approximate health. Day by day, his 
weight began to stumble off him. His exercise regimen faltered and 
fell apart, with his cheek against the surly basement floor. 

All through January, he managed to hold himself together, but by 
early February, Max was in worrisome shape. He would struggle to 
wake up next to the fire, sleeping well into the morning instead, his 
mouth distorted and his cheekbones starting to swell. When asked, he 
said he was fine. 

In mid-February, a few days before Liesel was thirteen, he came to 
the fireplace on the verge of collapse. He nearly fell into the fire. 

“Hans,” he whispered, and his face seemed to cramp. His legs gave 
way and his head hit the accordion case. 

At once, a wooden spoon fell into some soup and Rosa Hubermann 
was at his side. She held Max’s head and barked across the room at 
Liesel, “Don’t just stand there, get the extra blankets. Take them to 
your bed. And you!” Papa was next. “Help me pick him up and carry 
him to Liesel’s room. Schnell!” 

Papa’s face was stretched with concern. His gray eyes clanged and 
he picked him up on his own. Max was light as a child. “Can’t we put 
him here, in our bed?” 

Rosa had already considered that. “No. We have to keep these 
curtains open in the day or else it looks suspicious.” 

“Good point.” Hans carried him out. 
Blankets in hand, Liesel watched. 

Limp feet and hanging hair in the hallway. One shoe had fallen off 
him. 

“Move.” 
Mama marched in behind them, in her waddlesome way. 

Once Max was in the bed, blankets were heaped on top and fastened 
around his body. 

“Mama?” 
Liesel couldn’t bring herself to say anything else. 

“What?” The bun of Rosa Hubermann’s hair was wound tight 
enough to frighten from behind. It seemed to tighten further when 
she repeated the question. “What, Liesel?” 

She stepped closer, afraid of the answer. “Is he alive?” 
The bun nodded. 

Rosa turned then and said something with great assurance. “Now 
listen to me, Liesel. I didn’t take this man into my house to watch him 
die. Understand?” 

Liesel nodded. 
“Now go.” 

In the hall, Papa hugged her. 
She desperately needed it. 

Later on, she heard Hans and Rosa speaking in the night. Rosa made 
her sleep in their room, and she lay next to their bed, on the floor, on 
the mattress they’d dragged up from the basement. (There was 
concern as to whether it was infected, but they came to the 
conclusion that such thoughts were unfounded. This was no virus 
Max was suffering from, so they carried it up and replaced the sheet.) 
Imagining the girl to be asleep, Mama voiced her opinion. 
“That damn snowman,” she whispered. “I bet it started with the 
snowman—fooling around with ice and snow in the cold down there.” 
Papa was more philosophical. “Rosa, it started with Adolf.” He 
lifted himself. “We should check on him.” 

In the course of the night, Max was visited seven times. 

e ee MAX VANDENBURG’S VISITOR « « « 
SCORE SHEET 
Hans Hubermann: 2 
Rosa Hubermann: 2 
Liesel Meminger: 3 

In the morning, Liesel brought him his sketchbook from the basement 
and placed it on the bedside table. She felt awful for having looked at 
it the previous year, and this time, she kept it firmly closed, out of 
respect. 

When Papa came in, she did not turn to face him but talked across 

Max Vandenburg, at the wall. “Why did I have to bring all that snow 
down?” she asked. “It started all of this, didn’t it, Papa?” She 

clenched her hands, as if to pray. “Why did I have to build that 
snowman?” 

Papa, to his enduring credit, was adamant. “Liesel,” he said, “you 
had to.” 

For hours, she sat with him as he shivered and slept. 
“Don’t die,” she whispered. “Please, Max, just don’t die.” 

He was the second snowman to be melting away before her eyes, 
only this one was different. It was a paradox. 

The colder he became, the more he melted. 

THIRTEEN PRESENTS 

It was Max’s arrival, revisited. 
3 

Feathers turned to twigs again. Smooth face turned to rough. The 
proof she needed was there. He was alive. 

The first few days, she sat and talked to him. On her birthday, she 
told him there was an enormous cake waiting in the kitchen, if only 
he’d wake up. 

There was no waking. 
There was no cake. 

e e eA LATE-NIGHT EXCERPT = « « 
I realized much later that I actually visited 
33 Himmel Street in that period of time. 
It must have been one of the few moments when the 
girl was not there with him, for all I saw was a 
man in bed. I knelt. I readied myself to insert 
my hands through the blankets. Then there was a 
resurgence—an immense struggle against my weight. 
I withdrew, and with so much work ahead of me, 
it was nice to be fought off in that dark little room. 
I even managed a short, closed-eyed pause of 
serenity before I made my way out. 

On the fifth day, there was much excitement when Max opened his 
eyes, if only for a few moments. What he predominantly saw (and 

what a frightening version it must have been close-up) was Rosa 
Hubermann, practically slinging an armful of soup into his mouth. 
“Swallow,” she advised him. “Don’t think. Just swallow.” As soon as 
Mama handed back the bowl, Liesel tried to see his face again, but 
there was a soup-feeder’s backside in the way. 

“Ts he still awake?” 

When she turned, Rosa did not have to answer. 

After close to a week, Max woke up a second time, on this occasion 
with Liesel and Papa in the room. They were both watching the body 
in the bed when there was a small groan. If it’s possible, Papa fell 
upward, out of the chair. 

“Look,” Liesel gasped. “Stay awake, Max, stay awake.” 

He looked at her briefly, but there was no recognition. The eyes 
studied her as if she were a riddle. Then gone again. 

“Papa, what happened?” 
Hans dropped, back to the chair. 

Later, he suggested that perhaps she should read to him. “Come on, 
Liesel, you’re such a good reader these days—even if it’s a mystery to 
all of us where that book came from.” 

“T told you, Papa. One of the nuns at school gave it to me.” 

Papa held his hands up in mock-protest. “I know, I know.” He 
sighed, from a height. “Just ...” He chose his words gradually. “Don’t 
get caught.” This from a man who’d stolen a Jew. 

From that day on, Liesel read The Whistler aloud to Max as he 
occupied her bed. The one frustration was that she kept having to 
skip whole chapters on account of many of the pages being stuck 
together. It had not dried well. Still, she struggled on, to the point 
where she was nearly three-quarters of the way through it. The book 
was 396 pages. 

In the outside world, Liesel rushed from school each day in the hope 
that Max was feeling better. “Has he woken up? Has he eaten?” 

“Go back out,” Mama begged her. “You’re chewing a hole in my 
stomach with all this talking. Go on. Get out there and play soccer, 
for God’s sake.” 
“Yes, Mama.” She was about to open the door. “But you’ll come 
and get me if he wakes up, won’t you? Just make something up. 
Scream out like I’ve done something wrong. Start swearing at me. 
Everyone will believe it, don’t worry.” 

Even Rosa had to smile at that. She placed her knuckles on her hips 
and explained that Liesel wasn’t too old yet to avoid a Watschen for 
talking in such a way. “And score a goal,” she threatened, “or don’t 
come home at all.” 

“Sure, Mama.” 
“Make that two goals, Saumensch!” 
“Yes, Mama.” 
“And stop answering back!” 

Liesel considered, but she ran onto the street, to oppose Rudy on 
the mud-slippery road. 
“About time, ass scratcher.” He welcomed her in the customary 
way as they fought for the ball. “Where have you been?” 

Half an hour later, when the ball was squashed by the rare passage 
of a car on Himmel Street, Liesel had found her first present for Max 
Vandenburg. After judging it irreparable, all of the kids walked home 
in disgust, leaving the ball twitching on the cold, blistered road. 
Liesel and Rudy remained stooped over the carcass. There was a 
gaping hole on its side like a mouth. 

“You want it?” Liesel asked. 

Rudy shrugged. “What do I want with this squashed shit heap of a 
ball? There’s no chance of getting air into it now, is there?” 

“Do you want it or not?” 
“No thanks.” Rudy prodded it cautiously with his foot, as if it were 

a dead animal. Or an animal that might be dead. 

As he walked home, Liesel picked the ball up and placed it under 
her arm. She could hear him call out, “Hey, Saumensch.” She waited. 
“Saumensch!” 

She relented. “What?” 
“T’ve got a bike without wheels here, too, if you want it.” 
“Stick your bike.” 

From her position on the street, the last thing she heard was the 
laughter of that Saukerl, Rudy Steiner. 

Inside, she made her way to the bedroom. She took the ball in to Max 
and placed it at the end of the bed. 

“Pm sorry,” she said, “it’s not much. But when you wake up, Pl tell 
you all about it. Pll tell you it was the grayest afternoon you can 
imagine, and this car without its lights on ran straight over the ball. 
Then the man got out and yelled at us. And then he asked for 
directions. The nerve of him ...” 

Wake up! she wanted to scream. 
Or shake him. 
She didn’t. 

All Liesel could do was watch the ball and its trampled, flaking 
skin. It was the first gift of many. 

e e e PRESENTS #2-#5 © « « 
One ribbon, one pinecone. 
One button, one stone. 

The soccer ball had given her an idea. 

Whenever she walked to and from school now, Liesel was on the 
lookout for discarded items that might be valuable to a dying man. 

She wondered at first why it mattered so much. How could something 
so seemingly insignificant give comfort to someone? A ribbon in a 
gutter. A pinecone on the street. A button leaning casually against a 
classroom wall. A flat round stone from the river. If nothing else, it 
showed that she cared, and it might give them something to talk 
about when Max woke up. 

When she was alone, she would conduct those conversations. 
“So what’s all this?” Max would say. “What’s all this junk?” 

“Junk?” In her mind, she was sitting on the side of the bed. “This 
isn’t junk, Max. These are what made you wake up.” 

e e e PRESENTS #6-#9 « « « 
One feather, two newspapers. 
A candy wrapper. A cloud. 

The feather was lovely and trapped, in the door hinges of the church 
on Munich Street. It poked itself crookedly out and Liesel hurried 
over to rescue it. The fibers were combed flat on the left, but the right 
side was made of delicate edges and sections of jagged triangles. 
There was no other way of describing it. 
The newspapers came from the cold depths of a garbage can 
(enough said), and the candy wrapper was flat and faded. She found 
it near the school and held it up to the light. It contained a collage of 
shoe prints. 
Then the cloud. 
How do you give someone a piece of sky? 
Late in February, she stood on Munich Street and watched a single 
giant cloud come over the hills like a white monster. It climbed the 
mountains. The sun was eclipsed, and in its place, a white beast with 
a gray heart watched the town. 

“Would you look at that?” she said to Papa. 

Hans cocked his head and stated what he felt was the obvious. 
“You should give it to Max, Liesel. See if you can leave it on the 
bedside table, like all the other things.” 

Liesel watched him as if he’d gone insane. “How, though?” 

Lightly, he tapped her skull with his knuckles. “Memorize it. Then 
write it down for him.” 

“... It was like a great white beast,” she said at her next bedside vigil, 
“and it came from over the mountains.” 

When the sentence was completed with several different 
adjustments and additions, Liesel felt like she’d done it. She imagined 
the vision of it passing from her hand to his, through the blankets, 
and she wrote it down on a scrap of paper, placing the stone on top of 
it. 

e e e PRESENTS #10-#13 «© « « 
One toy soldier. One miraculous leaf. 
A finished whistler. 
A slab of grief. 

The soldier was buried in the dirt, not far from Tommy Miller’s place. 
It was scratched and trodden, which, to Liesel, was the whole point. 
Even with injury, it could still stand up. 

The leaf was a maple and she found it in the school broom closet, 
among the buckets and feather dusters. The door was slightly ajar. 
The leaf was dry and hard, like toasted bread, and there were hills 
and valleys all over its skin. Somehow, the leaf had made its way into 
the school hallway and into that closet. Like half a star with a stem. 
Liesel reached in and twirled it in her fingers. 

Unlike the other items, she did not place the leaf on the bedside 
table. She pinned it to the closed curtain, just before reading the final 
thirty-four pages of The Whistler. 

She did not have dinner that afternoon or go to the toilet. She 
didn’t drink. All day at school, she had promised herself that she 
would finish reading the book today, and Max Vandenburg was going 
to listen. He was going to wake up. 

Papa sat on the floor, in the corner, workless as usual. Luckily, he 
would soon be leaving for the Knoller with his accordion. His chin 
resting on his knees, he listened to the girl he’d struggled to teach the 
alphabet. Reading proudly, she unloaded the final frightening words 
of the book to Max Vandenburg. 

e e e THE LAST REMNANTS OF +% « « 
THE WHISTLER 
The Viennese air was fogging up the windows of the train that 
morning, and as the people traveled obliviously to work, a 
murderer whistled his happy tune. He bought his ticket. There 
were polite greetings with fellow passengers and the conductor. 
He even gave up his seat for an elderly lady and made polite 
conversation with a gambler who spoke of American horses. 
After all, the whistler loved talking. He talked to people and 
fooled them into liking him, trusting him. He talked to them 
while he was killing them, torturing and turning the knife. It 
was only when there was no one to talk to that he whistled, 
which was why he did so after a murder .... 

“So you think the track will suit number seven, do you?” 

“Of course.” The gambler grinned. Trust was already there. 
“He'll come from behind and kill the whole lot of them!” He 
shouted it above the noise of the train. 

“If you insist.” The whistler smirked, and he wondered at 
length when they would find the inspector’s body in that brand- 
new BMW. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” Hans couldn’t resist an incredulous tone. 
“A nun gave you that?” He stood up and made his way over, kissing 
her forehead. “Bye, Liesel, the Knoller awaits.” 

“Bye, Papa.” 
“Liesel!” 
She ignored it. 
“Come and eat something!” 

She answered now. “I’m coming, Mama.” She actually spoke those 
words to Max as she came closer and placed the finished book on the 
bedside table, with everything else. As she hovered above him, she 
couldn’t help herself. “Come on, Max,” she whispered, and even the 
sound of Mama’s arrival at her back did not stop her from silently 
crying. It didn’t stop her from pulling a lump of salt water from her 
eye and feeding it onto Max Vandenburg’s face. 

Mama took her. 
Her arms swallowed her. 
“I know,” she said. 
She knew. 

FRESH AIR, AN OLD NIGHTMARE, AND WHAT TO DO WITH A 
JEWISH CORPSE 

They were by the Amper River and Liesel had just told Rudy that she 
was interested in attaining another book from the mayor’s house. In 
place of The Whistler, she’d read The Standover Man several times at 
Max’s bedside. That was only a few minutes per reading. She’d also 
tried The Shoulder Shrug, even The Grave Digger’s Handbook, but none 
of it seemed quite right. I want something new, she thought. 

“Did you even read the last one?” 
“Of course I did.” 
Rudy threw a stone into the water. “Was it any good?” 
“Of course it was.” 

“Of course I did, of course it was.” He tried to dig another rock out of 
the ground but cut his finger. 

“That’ll teach you.” 
“Saumensch. ” 

When a person’s last response was Saumensch or Saukerl or 
Arschloch, you knew you had them beaten. 

In terms of stealing, conditions were perfect. It was a gloomy 
afternoon early in March and only a few degrees above freezing— 
always more uncomfortable than ten degrees below. Very few people 
were out on the streets. Rain like gray pencil shavings. 
“Are we going?” 
“Bikes,” said Rudy. “You can use one of ours.” 

On this occasion, Rudy was considerably more enthusiastic about 
being the enterer. “Today it’s my turn,” he said as their fingers froze 
to the bike handles. 
Liesel thought fast. “Maybe you shouldn’t, Rudy. There’s stuff all 
over the place in there. And it’s dark. An idiot like you is bound to 
trip over or run into something.” 

“Thanks very much.” In this mood, Rudy was hard to contain. 
“There’s the drop, too. It’s deeper than you think.” 
“Are you saying you don’t think I can do it?” 
Liesel stood up on the pedals. “Not at all.” 

They crossed the bridge and serpentined up the hill to Grande 
Strasse. The window was open. 

Like last time, they surveyed the house. Vaguely, they could see 
inside, to where a light was on downstairs, in what was probably the 
kitchen. A shadow moved back and forth. 

“We'll just ride around the block a few times,” Rudy said. “Lucky 
we brought the bikes, huh?” 

“Just make sure you remember to take yours home.” 
“Very funny, Saumensch. It’s a bit bigger than your filthy shoes.” 

They rode for perhaps fifteen minutes, and still, the mayor’s wife was 
downstairs, a little too close for comfort. How dare she occupy the 
kitchen with such vigilance! For Rudy, the kitchen was undoubtedly 
the actual goal. He’d have gone in, robbed as much food as was 
physically possible, then if (and only if) he had a last moment to 
spare, he would stuff a book down his pants on the way out. Any 
book would do. 

Rudy’s weakness, however, was impatience. “It’s getting late,” he 
said, and began to ride off. “You coming?” 

Liesel didn’t come. 

There was no decision to be made. She’d lugged that rusty bike all 
the way up there and she wasn’t leaving without a book. She placed 
the handlebars in the gutter, looked out for any neighbors, and 
walked to the window. There was good speed but no hurry. She took 
her shoes off using her feet, treading on the heels with her toes. 

Her fingers tightened on the wood and she made her way inside. 

This time, if only slightly, she felt more at ease. In a few precious 
moments, she circled the room, looking for a title that grabbed her. 
On three or four occasions, she nearly reached out. She even 
considered taking more than one, but again, she didn’t want to abuse 
what was a kind of system. For now, only one book was necessary. 
She studied the shelves and waited. 

An extra darkness climbed through the window behind her. The 
smell of dust and theft loitered in the background, and she saw it. 

The book was red, with black writing on the spine. Der Traumtrdger. 
The Dream Carrier. She thought of Max Vandenburg and his dreams. 
Of guilt. Surviving. Leaving his family. Fighting the Führer. She also 
thought of her own dream—her brother, dead on the train, and his 
appearance on the steps just around the corner from this very room. 
The book thief watched his bloodied knee from the shove of her own 
hand. 

She slid the book from the shelf, tucked it under her arm, climbed 
to the window ledge, and jumped out, all in one motion. 

Rudy had her shoes. He had her bike ready. Once the shoes were 
on, they rode. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, Meminger.” He’d never called her 
Meminger before. “You’re an absolute lunatic. Do you know that?” 

Liesel agreed as she pedaled like hell. “I know it.” 

At the bridge, Rudy summed up the afternoon’s proceedings. 
“Those people are either completely crazy,” he said, “or they just like 
their fresh air.” 

e e e A SMALL SUGGESTION = « « 

Or maybe there was a woman on 
Grande Strasse who now kept her 
library window open for another 
reason—but that’s just me being 
cynical, or hopeful. Or both. 

Liesel placed The Dream Carrier beneath her jacket and began reading 
it the minute she returned home. In the wooden chair next to her bed, 
she opened the book and whispered, “It’s a new one, Max. Just for 
you.” She started reading. “ ‘Chapter one: It was quite fitting that the 
entire town was sleeping when the dream carrier was born ....’ ” 

Every day, Liesel read two chapters of the book. One in the 
morning before school and one as soon as she came home. On certain 
nights, when she was not able to sleep, she read half of a third 
chapter as well. Sometimes she would fall asleep slumped forward 
onto the side of the bed. 

It became her mission. 

She gave The Dream Carrier to Max as if the words alone could 
nourish him. On a Tuesday, she thought there was movement. She 
could have sworn his eyes had opened. If they had, it was only 
momentarily, and it was more likely just her imagination and wishful 
thinking. 
By mid-March, the cracks began to appear. 

Rosa Hubermann—the good woman for a crisis—was at breaking 
point one afternoon in the kitchen. She raised her voice, then brought 
it quickly down. Liesel stopped reading and made her way quietly to 
the hall. As close as she stood, she could still barely make out her 
mama’s words. When she was able to hear them, she wished she 
hadn’t, for what she heard was horrific. It was reality. 

e e ¢ THE CONTENTS OF MAMA’S VOICE « « « 
“What if he doesn’t wake up? 

What if he dies here, Hansi? 
Tell me. What in God’s name will 
we do with the body? We can’t 
leave him here, the smell will 
kill us ... and we can’t carry 
him out the door and drag him up 
the street, either. We can’t just 
say, ‘You’ll never guess what we 
found in our basement this morning ....’ 
They’ll put us away for good.” 

She was absolutely right. 

A Jewish corpse was a major problem. The Hubermanns needed to 
revive Max Vandenburg not only for his sake, but for their own. Even 
Papa, who was always the ultimate calming influence, was feeling the 
pressure. 

“Look.” His voice was quiet but heavy. “If it happens—if he dies— 
we'll simply need to find a way.” Liesel could have sworn she heard 
him swallow. A gulp like a blow to the windpipe. “My paint cart, 
some drop sheets ...” 

Liesel entered the kitchen. 

“Not now, Liesel.” It was Papa who spoke, though he did not look 
at her. He was watching his warped face in a turned-over spoon. His 
elbows were buried into the table. 

The book thief did not retreat. She took a few extra steps and sat 
down. Her cold hands felt for her sleeves and a sentence dropped 
from her mouth. “He’s not dead yet.” The words landed on the table 
and positioned themselves in the middle. All three people looked at 
them. Half hopes didn’t dare rise any higher. He isn’t dead yet. He 
isn’t dead yet. It was Rosa who spoke next. 

“Who’s hungry?” 

Possibly the only time that Max’s illness didn’t hurt was at dinner. 
There was no denying it as the three of them sat at the kitchen table 
with their extra bread and extra soup or potatoes. They all thought it, 
but no one spoke. 

In the night, just a few hours later, Liesel awoke and wondered at the 
height of her heart. (She had learned that expression from The Dream 
Carrier, which was essentially the complete antithesis of The Whistler 
—a book about an abandoned child who wanted to be a priest.) She 
sat up and sucked deeply at the nighttime air. 

“Liesel?” Papa rolled over. “What is it?” 

“Nothing, Papa, everything’s good.” But the very moment she’d 
finished the sentence, she saw exactly what had happened in her 
dream. 

e © e ONE SMALL IMAGE « « « 
For the most part, all is identical. 
The train moves at the same speed. 
Copiously, her brother coughs. This 
time, however, Liesel cannot see his 
face watching the floor. Slowly, 
she leans over. Her hand lifts him 
gently, from his chin, and there 
in front of her is the wide-eyed face 
of Max Vandenburg. He stares at her. 
A feather drops to the floor. The 
body is bigger now, matching the 
size of the face. The train screams. 

“Liesel?” 

“T said everything’s good.” 

Shivering, she climbed from the mattress. Stupid with fear, she 
walked through the hallway to Max. After many minutes at his side, 
when everything slowed, she attempted to interpret the dream. Was it 
a premonition of Max’s death? Or was it merely a reaction to the 
afternoon conversation in the kitchen? Had Max now replaced her 
brother? And if so, how could she discard her own flesh and blood in 
such a way? Perhaps it was even a deep-seated wish for Max to die. 
After all, if it was good enough for Werner, her brother, it was good 
enough for this Jew. 

“Ts that what you think?” she whispered, standing above the bed. 
“No.” She could not believe it. Her answer was sustained as the 
numbness of the dark waned and outlined the various shapes, big and 
small, on the bedside table. The presents. 

“Wake up,” she said. 
Max did not wake up. 
For eight more days. 

At school, there was a rapping of knuckles on the door. 
“Come in,” called Frau Olendrich. 

The door opened and the entire classroom of children looked on in 
surprise as Rosa Hubermann stood in the doorway. One or two gasped 
at the sight—a small wardrobe of a woman with a lipstick sneer and 
chlorine eyes. This. Was the legend. She was wearing her best clothes, 
but her hair was a mess, and it was a towel of elastic gray strands. 

The teacher was obviously afraid. “Frau Hubermann ...” Her 
movements were cluttered. She searched through the class. “Liesel?” 

Liesel looked at Rudy, stood, and walked quickly toward the door 
to end the embarrassment as fast as possible. It shut behind her, and 
now she was alone, in the corridor, with Rosa. 

Rosa faced the other way. 
“What, Mama?” 

She turned. “Don’t you ‘what Mama’ me, you little Saumensch!” 
Liesel was gored by the speed of it. “My hairbrush!” A trickle of 
laughter rolled from under the door, but it was drawn instantly back. 

“Mama?” 

Her face was severe, but it was smiling. “What the hell did you do 
with my hairbrush, you stupid Saumensch, you little thief? I’ve told 
you a hundred times to leave that thing alone, but do you listen? Of 
course not!” 

The tirade went on for perhaps another minute, with Liesel making 
a desperate suggestion or two about the possible location of the said 
brush. It ended abruptly, with Rosa pulling Liesel close, just for a few 
seconds. Her whisper was almost impossible to hear, even at such 
close proximity. “You told me to yell at you. You said they’d all 
believe it.” She looked left and right, her voice like needle and thread. 
“He woke up, Liesel. He’s awake.” From her pocket, she pulled out 
the toy soldier with the scratched exterior. “He said to give you this. 
It was his favorite.” She handed it over, held her arms tightly, and 
smiled. Before Liesel had a chance to answer, she finished it off. 
“Well? Answer me! Do you have any other idea where you might 
have left it?” 

He’s alive, Liesel thought. “... No, Mama. I’m sorry, Mama, I—” 

“Well, what good are you, then?” She let go, nodded, and walked 
away. 

For a few moments, Liesel stood. The corridor was huge. She 
examined the soldier in her palm. Instinct told her to run home 
immediately, but common sense did not allow it. Instead, she placed 
the ragged soldier in her pocket and returned to the classroom. 

Everyone waited. 
“Stupid cow,” she whispered under her breath. 
Again, kids laughed. Frau Olendrich did not. 
“What was that?” 
Liesel was on such a high that she felt indestructible. “I said,” she 

beamed, “stupid cow,” and she didn’t have to wait a single moment 
for the teacher’s hand to slap her. 

“Don’t speak about your mother like that,” she said, but it had little 
effect. The girl merely stood there and attempted to hold off the grin. 
After all, she could take a Watschen with the best of them. “Now get 
to your seat.” 

“Yes, Frau Olendrich.” 
Next to her, Rudy dared to speak. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” he whispered, “I can see her hand on 
your face. A big red hand. Five fingers!” 

“Good,” said Liesel, because Max was alive. 

When she made it home that afternoon, he was sitting up in bed with 
the deflated soccer ball on his lap. His beard itched him and his 
swampy eyes fought to stay open. An empty bowl of soup was next to 
the gifts. 

They did not say hello. 
It was more like edges. 

The door creaked, the girl came in, and she stood before him, 
looking at the bowl. “Is Mama forcing it down your throat?” 

He nodded, content, fatigued. “It was very good, though.” 
“Mama’s soup? Really?” 

It was not a smile he gave her. “Thank you for the presents.” More 
just a slight tear of the mouth. “Thank you for the cloud. Your papa 
explained that one a little further.” 

After an hour, Liesel also made an attempt on the truth. “We didn’t 
know what we'd do if you’d died, Max. We—” 

It didn’t take him long. “You mean, how to get rid of me?” 
“Tm sorry.” 

“No.” He was not offended. “You were right.” He played weakly 
with the ball. “You were right to think that way. In your situation, a 

dead Jew is just as dangerous as a live one, if not worse.” 

“T also dreamed.” In detail, she explained it, with the soldier in her 
grip. She was on the verge of apologizing again when Max 
intervened. 

“Liesel.” He made her look at him. “Don’t ever apologize to me. It 
should be me who apologizes to you.” He looked at everything she’d 
brought him. “Look at all this. These gifts.” He held the button in his 
hand. “And Rosa said you read to me twice every day, sometimes 
three times.” Now he looked at the curtains as if he could see out of 
them. He sat up a little higher and paused for a dozen silent 
sentences. Trepidation found its way onto his face and he made a 
confession to the girl. “Liesel?” He moved slightly to the right. “Pm 
afraid,” he said, “of falling asleep again.” 

Liesel was resolute. “Then IIl read to you. And Pll slap your face if 
you start dozing off. Pll close the book and shake you till you wake 
up.” 
That afternoon, and well into the night, Liesel read to Max 
Vandenburg. He sat in bed and absorbed the words, awake this time, 
until just after ten o’clock. When Liesel took a quick rest from The 
Dream Carrier, she looked over the book and Max was asleep. 
Nervously, she nudged him with it. He awoke. 
Another three times, he fell asleep. Twice more, she woke him. 
For the next four days, he woke up every morning in Liesel’s bed, 
then next to the fireplace, and eventually, by mid-April, in the 
basement. His health had improved, the beard was gone, and small 
scraps of weight had returned. 
In Liesel’s inside world, there was great relief in that time. Outside, 
things were starting to look shaky. Late in March, a place called 
Lübeck was hailed with bombs. Next in line would be Cologne, and 
soon enough, many more German cities, including Munich. 
Yes, the boss was at my shoulder. 

“Get it done, get it done.” 

The bombs were coming—and so was I. 

DEATH’S DIARY: COLOGNE 

The fallen hours of May 30. 

’m sure Liesel Meminger was fast asleep when more than a 
thousand bomber planes flew toward a place known as Köln. For me, 
the result was five hundred people or thereabouts. Fifty thousand 
others ambled homelessly around the ghostly piles of rubble, trying to 
work out which way was which, and which slabs of broken home 
belonged to whom. 

Five hundred souls. 

I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or Pd throw them over 
my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms. 

By the time I was finished, the sky was yellow, like burning 
newspaper. If I looked closely, I could see the words, reporting 
headlines, commentating on the progress of the war and so forth. 
How I’d have loved to pull it all down, to screw up the newspaper sky 
and toss it away. My arms ached and I couldn’t afford to burn my 
fingers. There was still so much work to be done. 

As you might expect, many people died instantly. Others took a while 
longer. There were several more places to go, skies to meet and souls 
to collect, and when I came back to Cologne later on, not long after 
the final planes, I managed to notice a most unique thing. 

I was carrying the charred soul of a teenager when I looked gravely 
up at what was now a sulfuric sky. A group of ten-year-old girls was 
close by. One of them called out. 
“What’s that?” 

Her arm extended and her finger pointed out the black, slow object, 

falling from above. It began as a black feather, lilting, floating. Or a 
piece of ash. Then it grew larger. The same girl—a redhead with 
period freckles—spoke once again, this time more emphatically. 
“What is that?” 
“It’s a body,” another girl suggested. Black hair, pigtails, and a 
crooked part down the center. 
“Tt’s another bomb!” 
It was too slow to be a bomb. 
With the adolescent spirit still burning lightly in my arms, I walked 
a few hundred meters with the rest of them. Like the girls, I remained 
focused on the sky. The last thing I wanted was to look down at the 
stranded face of my teenager. A pretty girl. Her whole death was now 
ahead of her. 
Like the rest of them, I was taken aback when a voice lunged out. It 
was a disgruntled father, ordering his kids inside. The redhead 
reacted. Her freckles lengthened into commas. “But, Papa, look.” 
The man took several small steps and soon figured out what it was. 
“It’s the fuel,” he said. 

“What do you mean?” 

“The fuel,” he repeated. “The tank.” He was a bald man in 
disrupted bedclothes. “They used up all their fuel in that one and got 
rid of the empty container. Look, there’s another one over there.” 

“And there!” 

Kids being kids, they all searched frantically at that point, trying to 
find an empty fuel container floating to the ground. 

The first one landed with a hollow thud. 
“Can we keep it, Papa?” 
“No.” He was bombed and shocked, this papa, and clearly not in 
the mood. “We cannot keep it.” 

“Why not?” 
“Tm going to ask my papa if I can have it,” said another of the girls. 

“Me too.” 

Just past the rubble of Cologne, a group of kids collected empty fuel 
containers, dropped by their enemies. As usual, I collected humans. I 
was tired. And the year wasn’t even halfway over yet. 

THE VISITOR 

A new ball had been found for Himmel Street soccer. That was the 
good news. The somewhat unsettling news was that a division of the 
NSDAP was heading toward them. 

They’d progressed all the way through Molching, street by street, 
house by house, and now they stood at Frau Diller’s shop, having a 
quick smoke before they continued with their business. 

There was already a smattering of air-raid shelters in Molching, but 
it was decided soon after the bombing of Cologne that a few more 
certainly wouldn’t hurt. The NSDAP was inspecting each and every 
house in order to see if its basement was a good enough candidate. 

From afar, the children watched. 
They could see the smoke rising out of the pack. 

Liesel had only just come out and she’d walked over to Rudy and 
Tommy. Harald Mollenhauer was retrieving the ball. “What’s going 
on up there?” 

Rudy put his hands in his pockets. “The party.” He inspected his 
friend’s progress with the ball in Frau Holtzapfel’s front hedge. 
“They’re checking all the houses and apartment blocks.” 

Instant dryness seized the interior of Liesel’s mouth. “For what?” 
“Don’t you know anything? Tell her, Tommy.” 
Tommy was perplexed. “Well, I don’t know.” 

“Youre hopeless, the pair of you. They need more air-raid 
shelters.” 

“What—basements?” 

“No, attics. Of course basements. Jesus, Liesel, you really are thick, 
aren’t you?” 
The ball was back. 

“Rudy!” 
He played onto it and Liesel was still standing. How could she get 
back inside without looking too suspicious? The smoke up at Frau 
Diller’s was disappearing and the small crowd of men was starting to 
disperse. Panic generated in that awful way. Throat and mouth. Air 
became sand. Think, she thought. Come on, Liesel, think, think. 

Rudy scored. 
Faraway voices congratulated him. 
Think, Liesel— 
She had it. 
That’s it, she decided, but I have to make it real. 

As the Nazis progressed down the street, painting the letters LSR on 
some of the doors, the ball was passed through the air to one of the 
bigger kids, Klaus Behrig. 

eee LSR eee 
Luft Schutz Raum: 
Air-Raid Shelter 

The boy turned with the ball just as Liesel arrived, and they collided 
with such force that the game stopped automatically. As the ball 
rolled off, players ran in. Liesel held her grazed knee with one hand 
and her head with the other. Klaus Behrig only held his right shin, 
grimacing and cursing. “Where is she?” he spat. “I’m going to kill 
her!” 
There would be no killing. 
It was worse. 

A kindly party member had seen the incident and jogged dutifully 
down to the group. “What happened here?” he asked. 

“Well, she’s a maniac.” Klaus pointed at Liesel, prompting the man 

to help her up. His tobacco breath formed a smoky sandhill in front of 
her face. 
“T don’t think you’re in any state to keep playing, my girl,” he said. 
“Where do you live?” 
“Pm fine,” she answered, “really. I can make it myself.” Just get off 
me, get off me! 
That was when Rudy stepped in, the eternal stepper-inner. “PI help 
you home,” he said. Why couldn’t he just mind his own business for a 
change? 
“Really,” Liesel said. “Just keep playing, Rudy. I can make it.” 
“No, no.” He wouldn’t be shifted. The stubbornness of him! “It’ll 
only take a minute or two.” 
Again, she had to think, and again, she was able. With Rudy 
holding her up, she made herself drop once more to the ground, on 
her back. “My papa,” she said. The sky, she noticed, was utterly blue. 
Not even the suggestion of a cloud. “Could you get him, Rudy?” 
“Stay there.” To his right, he called out, “Tommy, watch her, will 
you? Don’t let her move.” 
Tommy snapped into action. “Pll watch her, Rudy.” He stood above 
her, twitching and trying not to smile, as Liesel kept an eye on the 
party man. 

A minute later, Hans Hubermann was standing calmly above her. 
“Hey, Papa.” 
A disappointed smile mingled with his lips. “I was wondering when 
this would happen.” 
He picked her up and helped her home. The game went on, and the 
Nazi was already at the door of a lodging a few doors up. No one 
answered. Rudy was calling out again. 
“Do you need help, Herr Hubermann?” 
“No, no, you keep playing, Herr Steiner.” Herr Steiner. You had to 
love Liesel’s papa. 

Once inside, Liesel gave him the information. She attempted to find 
the middle ground between silence and despair. “Papa.” 

“Don’t talk.” 

“The party,” she whispered. Papa stopped. He fought off the urge to 
open the door and look up the street. “They’re checking basements to 
make shelters.” 

He set her down. “Smart girl,” he said, then called for Rosa. 

They had a minute to come up with a plan. A shemozzle of thoughts. 

“We'll just put him in Liesel’s room,” was Mama’s suggestion. 
“Under the bed.” 

“That’s it? What if they decide to search our rooms as well?” 
“Do you have a better plan?” 
Correction: they did not have a minute. 

A seven-punch knock was hammered into the door of 33 Himmel 
Street, and it was too late to move anyone anywhere. 

The voice. 
“Open up!” 
Their heartbeats fought each other, a mess of rhythm. Liesel tried 
to eat hers down. The taste of heart was not too cheerful. 
Rosa whispered, “Jesus, Mary—” 

On this day, it was Papa who rose to the occasion. He rushed to the 
basement door and threw a warning down the steps. When he 
returned, he spoke fast and fluent. “Look, there is no time for tricks. 
We could distract him a hundred different ways, but there is only one 
solution.” He eyed the door and summed up. “Nothing.” 

That was not the answer Rosa wanted. Her eyes widened. 
“Nothing? Are you crazy?” 

The knocking resumed. 
Papa was strict. “Nothing. We don’t even go down there—not a 

care in the world.” 
Everything slowed. 
Rosa accepted it. 

Clenched with distress, she shook her head and proceeded to 
answer the door. 

“Liesel.” Papa’s voice sliced her up. “Just stay calm, verstehst?” 
“Yes, Papa.” 
She tried to concentrate on her bleeding leg. 

“Aha! 99 

At the door, Rosa was still asking the meaning of this interruption 
when the kindly party man noticed Liesel. 

“The maniacal soccer player!” He grinned. “How’s the knee?” You 
don’t usually imagine the Nazis being too chirpy, but this man 
certainly was. He came in and made as if to crouch and view the 
injury. 
Does he know? Liesel thought. Can he smell we’re hiding a Jew? 

Papa came from the sink with a wet cloth and soaked it onto 
Liesel’s knee. “Does it sting?” His silver eyes were caring and calm. 
The scare in them could easily be mistaken as concern for the injury. 
Rosa called across the kitchen, “It can’t sting enough. Maybe it will 
teach her a lesson.” 
The party man stood and laughed. “I don’t think this girl is learning 
any lessons out there, Frau ...?” 
“Hubermann.” The cardboard contorted. 
“... Frau Hubermann—I think she teaches lessons.” He handed 
Liesel a smile. “To all those boys. Am I right, young girl?” 
Papa shoved the cloth into the graze and Liesel winced rather than 
answered. It was Hans who spoke. A quiet “sorry,” to the girl. 

There was the discomfort of silence then, and the party man 

remembered his purpose. “If you don’t mind,” he explained, “I need 
to inspect your basement, just for a minute or two, to see if it’s 
suitable for a shelter.” 

Papa gave Liesel’s knee a final dab. “You'll have a nice bruise there, 
too, Liesel.” Casually, he acknowledged the man above them. 
“Certainly. First door on the right. Please excuse the mess.” 

“T wouldn’t worry—it can’t be worse than some of the others I’ve 
seen today .... This one?” 

“That’s it.” 

e e ¢ THE LONGEST THREE MINUTES « « « 
IN HUBERMANN HISTORY 
Papa sat at the table. Rosa prayed in the corner, 
mouthing the words. Liesel was cooked: her knee, 
her chest, the muscles in her arms. I doubt any 
of them had the audacity to consider what they’d 
do if the basement was appointed as a shelter. 
They had to survive the inspection first. 

They listened to Nazi footsteps in the basement. There was the sound 
of measuring tape. Liesel could not ward off the thought of Max 
sitting beneath the steps, huddled around his sketchbook, hugging it 
to his chest. 

Papa stood. Another idea. 

He walked to the hall and called out, “Everything good down 
there?” 

The answer ascended the steps, on top of Max Vandenburg. 
“Another minute, perhaps!” 

“Would you like some coffee, some tea?” 
“No thank you!” 

When Papa returned, he ordered Liesel to fetch a book and for Rosa 
to start cooking. He decided the last thing they should do was sit 
around looking worried. “Well, come on,” he said loudly, “move it, 
Liesel. I don’t care if your knee hurts. You have to finish that book, 
like you said.” 

Liesel tried not to break. “Yes, Papa.” 

“What are you waiting for?” It took great effort to wink at her, she 
could tell. 

In the corridor, she nearly collided with the party man. 

“In trouble with your papa, huh? Never mind. Pm the same with 
my own children.” 

They walked their separate ways, and when Liesel made it to her 
room, she closed the door and fell to her knees, despite the added 
pain. She listened first to the judgment that the basement was too 
shallow, then the goodbyes, one of which was sent down the corridor. 
“Goodbye, maniacal soccer player!” 

She remembered herself. “Auf Wiedersehen! Goodbye!” 
The Dream Carrier simmered in her hands. 

According to Papa, Rosa melted next to the stove the moment the 
party man was gone. They collected Liesel and made their way to the 
basement, removing the well-placed drop sheets and paint cans. Max 
Vandenburg sat beneath the steps, holding his rusty scissors like a 
knife. His armpits were soggy and the words fell like injuries from his 
mouth. 

“T wouldn’t have used them,” he quietly said. “Tm ...” He held the 
rusty arms flat against his forehead. “I’m so sorry I put you through 
that.” 

Papa lit a cigarette. Rosa took the scissors. 
“You're alive,” she said. “We all are.” 
It was too late now for apologies. 

THE SCHMUNZELER 

Minutes later, a second knocker was at the door. 
“Good Lord, another one!” 
Worry resumed immediately. 
Max was covered up. 

Rosa trudged up the basement steps, but when she opened the door 
this time, it was not the Nazis. It was none other than Rudy Steiner. 
He stood there, yellow-haired and good-intentioned. “I just came to 
see how Liesel is.” 

When she heard his voice, Liesel started making her way up the 
steps. “I can deal with this one.” 

“Her boyfriend,” Papa mentioned to the paint cans. He blew 
another mouthful of smoke. 

“He is not my boyfriend,” Liesel countered, but she was not 
irritated. It was impossible after such a close call. “I’m only going up 
because Mama will be yelling out any second.” 

“Liesel!” 
She was on the fifth step. “See?” 

When she reached the door, Rudy moved from foot to foot. “I just 
came to see—” He stopped. “What’s that smell?” He sniffed. “Have 
you been smoking in there?” 

“Oh. I was sitting with Papa.” 
“Do you have any cigarettes? Maybe we can sell some.” 

Liesel wasn’t in the mood for this. She spoke quietly enough so that 
Mama wouldn’t hear. “I don’t steal from my papa.” 

“But you steal from certain other places.” 
“Talk a bit louder, why don’t you.” 
Rudy schmunzeled. “See what stealing does? You’re all worried.” 
“Like you’ve never stolen anything.” 

“Yes, but you reek of it.” Rudy was really warming up now. “Maybe 
that’s not cigarette smoke after all.” He leaned closer and smiled. “It’s 
a criminal I can smell. You should have a bath.” He shouted back to 
Tommy Muller. “Hey, Tommy, you should come and have a smell of 
this!” 

“What did you say?” Trust Tommy. “I can’t hear you!” 
Rudy shook his head in Liesel’s direction. “Useless.” 

She started shutting the door. “Get lost, Saukerl, you’re the last 
thing I need right now.” 

Very pleased with himself, Rudy made his way back to the street. 
At the mailbox, he seemed to remember what he’d wanted to verify 
all along. He came back a few steps. “Alles gut, Saumensch? The 
injury, I mean.” 

It was June. It was Germany. 
Things were on the verge of decay. 

Liesel was unaware of this. For her, the Jew in her basement had 
not been revealed. Her foster parents were not taken away, and she 
herself had contributed greatly to both of these accomplishments. 
“Everything’s good,” she said, and she was not talking about a 
soccer injury of any description. 

She was fine. 

DEATH’S DIARY: THE PARISIANS 

Summer came. 
For the book thief, everything was going nicely. 
For me, the sky was the color of Jews. 

When their bodies had finished scouring for gaps in the door, their 
souls rose up. When their fingernails had scratched at the wood and 
in some cases were nailed into it by the sheer force of desperation, 
their spirits came toward me, into my arms, and we climbed out of 
those shower facilities, onto the roof and up, into eternity’s certain 
breadth. They just kept feeding me. Minute after minute. Shower after 
shower. 
Pll never forget the first day in Auschwitz, the first time in 
Mauthausen. At that second place, as time wore on, I also picked 
them up from the bottom of the great cliff, when their escapes fell 
awfully awry. There were broken bodies and dead, sweet hearts. Still, 
it was better than the gas. Some of them I caught when they were 
only halfway down. Saved you, I’d think, holding their souls in midair 
as the rest of their being—their physical shells—plummeted to the 
earth. All of them were light, like the cases of empty walnuts. Smoky 
sky in those places. The smell like a stove, but still so cold. 
I shiver when I remember—as I try to de-realize it. 
I blow warm air into my hands, to heat them up. 
But it’s hard to keep them warm when the souls still shiver. 
God. 
I always say that name when I think of it. 
God. 

Twice, I speak it. 

I say His name in a futile attempt to understand. “But it’s not your 
job to understand.” That’s me who answers. God never says anything. 
You think you’re the only one he never answers? “Your job is to ...” 
And I stop listening to me, because to put it bluntly, I tire me. When I 
start thinking like that, I become so exhausted, and I don’t have the 
luxury of indulging fatigue. ’m compelled to continue on, because 
although it’s not true for every person on earth, it’s true for the vast 
majority—that death waits for no man—and if he does, he doesn’t 
usually wait very long. 

On June 23, 1942, there was a group of French Jews in a German 
prison, on Polish soil. The first person I took was close to the door, his 
mind racing, then reduced to pacing, then slowing down, slowing 
down .... 

Please believe me when I tell you that I picked up each soul that day 
as if it were newly born. I even kissed a few weary, poisoned cheeks. I 
listened to their last, gasping cries. Their vanishing words. I watched 
their love visions and freed them from their fear. 

I took them all away, and if ever there was a time I needed 
distraction, this was it. In complete desolation, I looked at the world 
above. I watched the sky as it turned from silver to gray to the color 
of rain. Even the clouds were trying to get away. 

Sometimes I imagined how everything looked above those clouds, 
knowing without question that the sun was blond, and the endless 
atmosphere was a giant blue eye. 

They were French, they were Jews, and they were you.

CHAMPAGNE AND ACCORDIONS 

In the summer of 1942, the town of Molching was preparing for the 
inevitable. There were still people who refused to believe that this 
small town on Munich’s outskirts could be a target, but the majority 
of the population was well aware that it was not a question of if, but 
when. Shelters were more clearly marked, windows were in the 
process of being blackened for the nights, and everyone knew where 
the closest basement or cellar was. 

For Hans Hubermann, this uneasy development was actually a 
slight reprieve. At an unfortunate time, good luck had somehow 
found its way into his painting business. People with blinds were 
desperate enough to enlist his services to paint them. His problem 
was that black paint was normally used more as a mixer, to darken 
other colors, and it was soon depleted and hard to find. What he did 
have was the knack of being a good tradesman, and a good tradesman 
has many tricks. He took coal dust and stirred it through, and he 
worked cheap. There were many houses in all parts of Molching in 
which he confiscated the window light from enemy eyes. 

On some of his workdays, Liesel went with him. 

They carted his paint through town, smelling the hunger on some 
of the streets and shaking their heads at the wealth on others. Many 
times, on the way home, women with nothing but kids and poverty 
would come running out and plead with him to paint their blinds. 

“Frau Hallah, I’m sorry, I have no black paint left,” he would say, 
but a little farther down the road, he would always break. There was 
tall man and long street. “Tomorrow,” he’d promise, “first thing,” and 
when the next morning dawned, there he was, painting those blinds 
for nothing, or for a cookie or a warm cup of tea. The previous 
evening, he’d have found another way to turn blue or green or beige 
to black. Never did he tell them to cover their windows with spare 

blankets, for he knew they’d need them when winter came. He was 
even known to paint people’s blinds for half a cigarette, sitting on the 
front step of a house, sharing a smoke with the occupant. Laughter 
and smoke rose out of the conversation before they moved on to the 
next job. 

When the time came to write, I remember clearly what Liesel 
Meminger had to say about that summer. A lot of the words have 
faded over the decades. The paper has suffered from the friction of 
movement in my pocket, but still, many of her sentences have been 
impossible to forget. 

e e e A SMALL SAMPLE OF SOME « « à 
GIRL-WRITTEN WORDS 
That summer was a new beginning, a new end. 
When I look back, I remember my slippery 
hands of paint and the sound of Papa’s feet 
on Munich Street, and I know that a small 
piece of the summer of 1942 belonged to only 
one man. Who else would do some painting for 
the price of half a cigarette? That was Papa, 
that was typical, and I loved him. 

Every day when they worked together, he would tell Liesel his stories. 
There was the Great War and how his miserable handwriting helped 
save his life, and the day he met Mama. He said that she was 
beautiful once, and actually very quiet-spoken. “Hard to believe, I 
know, but absolutely true.” Each day, there was a story, and Liesel 
forgave him if he told the same one more than once. 

On other occasions, when she was daydreaming, Papa would dab 
her lightly with his brush, right between the eyes. If he misjudged 

and there was too much on it, a small path of paint would dribble 
down the side of her nose. She would laugh and try to return the 
favor, but Hans Hubermann was a hard man to catch out at work. It 
was there that he was most alive. 

Whenever they had a break, to eat or drink, he would play the 
accordion, and it was this that Liesel remembered best. Each morning, 
while Papa pushed or dragged the paint cart, Liesel carried the 
instrument. “Better that we leave the paint behind,” Hans told her, 
“than ever forget the music.” When they paused to eat, he would cut 
up the bread, smearing it with what little jam remained from the last 
ration card. Or he’d lay a small slice of meat on top of it. They would 
eat together, sitting on their cans of paint, and with the last 
mouthfuls still in the chewing stages, Papa would be wiping his 
fingers, unbuckling the accordion case. 

Traces of bread crumbs were in the creases of his overalls. Paint- 
specked hands made their way across the buttons and raked over the 
keys, or held on to a note for a while. His arms worked the bellows, 
giving the instrument the air it needed to breathe. 

Liesel would sit each day with her hands between her knees, in the 
long legs of daylight. She wanted none of those days to end, and it 
was always with disappointment that she watched the darkness stride 
forward. 

As far as the painting itself was concerned, probably the most 
interesting aspect for Liesel was the mixing. Like most people, she 
assumed her papa simply took his cart to the paint shop or hardware 
store and asked for the right color and away he went. She didn’t 
realize that most of the paint was in lumps, in the shape of a brick. It 
was then rolled out with an empty champagne bottle. (Champagne 
bottles, Hans explained, were ideal for the job, as their glass was 
slightly thicker than that of an ordinary bottle of wine.) Once that 
was completed, there was the addition of water, whiting, and glue, 
not to mention the complexities of matching the right color. 

The science of Papa’s trade brought him an even greater level of 
respect. It was well and good to share bread and music, but it was 
nice for Liesel to know that he was also more than capable in his 
occupation. Competence was attractive. 

One afternoon, a few days after Papa’s explanation of the mixing, 
they were working at one of the wealthier houses just east of Munich 
Street. Papa called Liesel inside in the early afternoon. They were just 
about to move on to another job when she heard the unusual volume 
in his voice. 

Once inside, she was taken to the kitchen, where two older women 
and a man sat on delicate, highly civilized chairs. The women were 
well dressed. The man had white hair and sideburns like hedges. Tall 
glasses stood on the table. They were filled with crackling liquid. 

“Well,” said the man, “here we go.” 
He took up his glass and urged the others to do the same. 

The afternoon had been warm. Liesel was slightly put off by the 
coolness of her glass. She looked at Papa for approval. He grinned 
and said, “Prost, Mddel—cheers, girl.” Their glasses chimed together 
and the moment Liesel raised it to her mouth, she was bitten by the 
fizzy, sickly sweet taste of champagne. Her reflexes forced her to spit 
straight onto her papa’s overalls, watching it foam and dribble. A shot 
of laughter followed from all of them, and Hans encouraged her to 
give it another try. On the second attempt she was able to swallow it, 
and enjoy the taste of a glorious broken rule. It felt great. The bubbles 
ate her tongue. They prickled her stomach. Even as they walked to 
the next job, she could feel the warmth of pins and needles inside her. 

Dragging the cart, Papa told her that those people claimed to have 
no money. 
“So you asked for champagne?” 
“Why not?” He looked across, and never had his eyes been so 
silver. “I didn’t want you thinking that champagne bottles are only 
used for rolling paint.” He warned her, “Just don’t tell Mama. 

Agreed?” 
“Can I tell Max?” 
“Sure, you can tell Max.” 

In the basement, when she wrote about her life, Liesel vowed that she 
would never drink champagne again, for it would never taste as good 
as it did on that warm afternoon in July. 

It was the same with accordions. 

Many times, she wanted to ask her papa if he might teach her to 
play, but somehow, something always stopped her. Perhaps an 
unknown intuition told her that she would never be able to play it 
like Hans Hubermann. Surely, not even the world’s greatest 
accordionists could compare. They could never be equal to the casual 
concentration on Papa’s face. Or there wouldn’t be a paintwork- 
traded cigarette slouched on the player’s lips. And they could never 
make a small mistake with a three-note laugh of hindsight. Not the 
way he could. 

At times, in that basement, she woke up tasting the sound of the 
accordion in her ears. She could feel the sweet burn of champagne on 
her tongue. 
Sometimes she sat against the wall, longing for the warm finger of 
paint to wander just once more down the side of her nose, or to 
watch the sandpaper texture of her papa’s hands. 
If only she could be so oblivious again, to feel such love without 
knowing it, mistaking it for laughter and bread with only the scent of 
jam spread out on top of it. 

It was the best time of her life. 

But it was bombing carpet. 
Make no mistake. 

Bold and bright, a trilogy of happiness would continue for summer’s 
duration and into autumn. It would then be brought abruptly to an 
end, for the brightness had shown suffering the way. 

Hard times were coming. 
Like a parade.

THE TRILOGY 

While Liesel worked, Rudy ran. 

He did laps of Hubert Oval, ran around the block, and raced almost 
everyone from the bottom of Himmel Street to Frau Diller’s, giving 
varied head starts. 

On a few occasions, when Liesel was helping Mama in the kitchen, 
Rosa would look out the window and say, “What’s that little Saukerl 
up to this time? All that running out there.” 

Liesel would move to the window. “At least he hasn’t painted 
himself black again.” 

“Well, that’s something, isn’t it?” 

e e e RUDY’S REASONS « « « 
In the middle of August, a Hitler Youth 
carnival was being held, and Rudy was 
intent on winning four events: the 1500, 
400, 200, and of course, the 100. He liked 
his new Hitler Youth leaders and wanted to 
please them, and he wanted to show his old 
friend Franz Deutscher a thing or two. 

“Four gold medals,” he said to Liesel one afternoon when she did laps 
with him at Hubert Oval. “Like Jesse Owens back in ’36.” 

“Youre not still obsessed with him, are you?” 

Rudy’s feet rhymed with his breathing. “Not really, but it would be 
nice, wouldn’t it? It would show all those bastards who said I was 
crazy. They’d see that I wasn’t so stupid after all.” 

“But can you really win all four events?” 

They slowed to a stop at the end of the track, and Rudy placed his 
hands on his hips. “I have to.” 

For six weeks, he trained, and when the day of the carnival arrived in 
mid-August, the sky was hot-sunned and cloudless. The grass was 
overrun with Hitler Youths, parents, and a glut of brown-shirted 
leaders. Rudy Steiner was in peak condition. 

“Look,” he pointed out. “There’s Deutscher.” 

Through the clusters of crowd, the blond epitome of Hitler Youth 
standards was giving instructions to two members of his division. 
They were nodding and occasionally stretching. One of them shielded 
his eyes from the sun like a salute. 

“You want to say hello?” Liesel asked. 
“No thanks. rll do that later.” 
When I’ve won. 

The words were not spoken, but they were definitely there, 
somewhere between Rudy’s blue eyes and Deutscher’s advisory hands. 

There was the obligatory march around the grounds. 
The anthem. 
Heil Hitler. 
Only then could they begin. 

When Rudy’s age group was called for the 1500, Liesel wished him 
luck in a typically German manner. 

“Hals und Beinbruch, Saukerl.” 
She’d told him to break his neck and leg. 

Boys collected themselves on the far side of the circular field. Some 
stretched, some focused, and the rest were there because they had to 
be. 

Next to Liesel, Rudy’s mother, Barbara, sat with her youngest 
children. A thin blanket was brimming with kids and loosened grass. 
“Can you see Rudy?” she asked them. “He’s the one on the far left.” 
Barbara Steiner was a kind woman whose hair always looked recently 
combed. 

“Where?” said one of the girls. Probably Bettina, the youngest. “I 
can’t see him at all.” 

“That last one. No, not there. There.” 

They were still in the identification process when the starter’s gun 
gave off its smoke and sound. The small Steiners rushed to the fence. 

For the first lap, a group of seven boys led the field. On the second, 
it dropped to five, and on the next lap, four. Rudy was the fourth 
runner on every lap until the last. A man on the right was saying that 
the boy coming second looked the best. He was the tallest. “You 
wait,” he told his nonplussed wife. “With two hundred left, he’ll 
break away.” The man was wrong. 

A gargantuan brown-shirted official informed the group that there 
was one lap to go. He certainly wasn’t suffering under the ration 
system. He called out as the lead pack crossed the line, and it was not 
the second boy who accelerated, but the fourth. And he was two 
hundred meters early. 

Rudy ran. 
He did not look back at any stage. 

Like an elastic rope, he lengthened his lead until any thought of 
someone else winning snapped altogether. He took himself around 
the track as the three runners behind him fought each other for the 

scraps. In the homestretch, there was nothing but blond hair and 
space, and when he crossed the line, he didn’t stop. He didn’t raise his 
arm. There wasn’t even a bent-over relief. He simply walked another 
twenty meters and eventually looked over his shoulder to watch the 
others cross the line. 

On the way back to his family, he met first with his leaders and 
then with Franz Deutscher. They both nodded. 

“Steiner.” 
“Deutscher.” 
“Looks like all those laps I gave you paid off, huh?” 
“Looks like it.” 
He would not smile until he’d won all four. 

e e eA POINT FOR LATER REFERENCE « « « 
Not only was Rudy recognized now as a good 
school student. He was a gifted athlete, too. 

For Liesel, there was the 400. She finished seventh, then fourth in her 
heat of the 200. All she could see up ahead were the hamstrings and 
bobbing ponytails of the girls in front. In the long jump, she enjoyed 
the sand packed around her feet more than any distance, and the shot 
put wasn’t her greatest moment, either. This day, she realized, was 
Rudy’s. 

In the 400 final, he led from the backstretch to the end, and he won 
the 200 only narrowly. 
“You getting tired?” Liesel asked him. It was early afternoon by 
then. 

“Of course not.” He was breathing heavily and stretching his calves. 
“What are you talking about, Saumensch? What the hell would you 
know?” 

When the heats of the 100 were called, he rose slowly to his feet 

and followed the trail of adolescents toward the track. Liesel went 
after him. “Hey, Rudy.” She pulled at his shirtsleeve. “Good luck.” 

“Tm not tired,” he said. 
“I know.” 
He winked at her. 
He was tired. 

In his heat, Rudy slowed to finish second, and after ten minutes of 
other races, the final was called. Two other boys had looked 
formidable, and Liesel had a feeling in her stomach that Rudy could 
not win this one. Tommy Müller, who’d finished second to last in his 
heat, stood with her at the fence. “He’ll win it,” he informed her. 

“I know.” 
No, he won’t. 

When the finalists reached the starting line, Rudy dropped to his 
knees and began digging starting holes with his hands. A balding 
brownshirt wasted no time in walking over and telling him to cut it 
out. Liesel watched the adult finger, pointing, and she could see the 
dirt falling to the ground as Rudy brushed his hands together. 

When they were called forward, Liesel tightened her grip on the 
fence. One of the boys false-started; the gun was shot twice. It was 
Rudy. Again, the official had words with him and the boy nodded. 
Once more and he was out. 

Set for the second time, Liesel watched with concentration, and for 
the first few seconds, she could not believe what she was seeing. 
Another false start was recorded and it was the same athlete who had 
done it. In front of her, she created a perfect race, in which Rudy 
trailed but came home to win in the last ten meters. What she 
actually saw, however, was Rudy’s disqualification. He was escorted 
to the side of the track and was made to stand there, alone, as the 
remainder of boys stepped forward. 

They lined up and raced. 

A boy with rusty brown hair and a big stride won by at least five 
meters. 

Rudy remained. 

Later, when the day was complete and the sun was taken from 
Himmel Street, Liesel sat with her friend on the footpath. 

They talked about everything else, from Franz Deutscher’s face 
after the 1500 to one of the eleven-year-old girls having a tantrum 
after losing the discus. 

Before they proceeded to their respective homes, Rudy’s voice 
reached over and handed Liesel the truth. For a while, it sat on her 
shoulder, but a few thoughts later, it made its way to her ear. 

e e e RUDY’S VOICE «= « « 
“I did it on purpose.” 

When the confession registered, Liesel asked the only question 
available. “But why, Rudy? Why did you do it?” 

He was standing with a hand on his hip, and he did not answer. 
There was nothing but a knowing smile and a slow walk that lolled 
him home. They never talked about it again. 

For Liesel’s part, she often wondered what Rudy’s answer might 
have been had she pushed him. Perhaps three medals had shown 
what he’d wanted to show, or he was afraid to lose that final race. In 
the end, the only explanation she allowed herself to hear was an inner 
teenage voice. 

“Because he isn’t Jesse Owens.” 

Only when she got up to leave did she notice the three imitation- 
gold medals sitting next to her. She knocked on the Steiners’ door and 
held them out to him. “You forgot these.” 

“No, I didn’t.” He closed the door and Liesel took the medals home. 
She walked with them down to the basement and told Max about her 
friend Rudy Steiner. 

“He truly is stupid,” she concluded. 
“Clearly,” Max agreed, but I doubt he was fooled. 
They both started work then, Max on his sketchbook, Liesel on The 
Dream Carrier. She was in the latter stages of the novel, where the 
young priest was doubting his faith after meeting a strange and 
elegant woman. 
When she placed it facedown on her lap, Max asked when she 
thought she’d finish it. 
“A few days at the most.” 
“Then a new one?” 

The book thief looked at the basement ceiling. “Maybe, Max.” She 
closed the book and leaned back. “If rm lucky.” 

e e ¢ THE NEXT BOOK « « « 
It’s not the Duden Dictionary and 
Thesaurus, as you might be expecting. 

No, the dictionary comes at the end of this small trilogy, and this is 
only the second installment. This is the part where Liesel finishes The 
Dream Carrier and steals a story called A Song in the Dark. As always, 
it was taken from the mayor’s house. The only difference was that she 
made her way to the upper part of town alone. There was no Rudy 
that day. 

It was a morning rich with both sun and frothy clouds. 

Liesel stood in the mayor’s library with greed in her fingers and 
book titles at her lips. She was comfortable enough on this occasion 
to run her fingers along the shelves—a short replay of her original 
visit to the room—and she whispered many of the titles as she made 
her way along. 

Under the Cherry Tree. 
The Tenth Lieutenant. 

Typically, many of the titles tempted her, but after a good minute 
or two in the room, she settled for A Song in the Dark, most likely 
because the book was green, and she did not yet own a book of that 
color. The engraved writing on the cover was white, and there was a 
small insignia of a flute between the title and the name of the author. 
She climbed with it from the window, saying thanks on her way out. 

Without Rudy, she felt a good degree of absence, but on that 
particular morning, for some reason, the book thief was happiest 
alone. She went about her work and read the book next to the Amper 
River, far enough away from the occasional headquarters of Viktor 
Chemmel and the previous gang of Arthur Berg. No one came, no one 
interrupted, and Liesel read four of the very short chapters of A Song 
in the Dark, and she was happy. 
It was the pleasure and satisfaction. 

Of good stealing. 

A week later, the trilogy of happiness was completed. 
In the last days of August, a gift arrived, or in fact, was noticed. 

It was late afternoon. Liesel was watching Kristina Müller jumping 
rope on Himmel Street. Rudy Steiner skidded to a stop in front of her 
on his brother’s bike. “Do you have some time?” he asked. 

She shrugged. “For what?” 

“I think you’d better come.” He dumped the bike and went to 
collect the other one from home. In front of her, Liesel watched the 
pedal spin. 

They rode up to Grande Strasse, where Rudy stopped and waited. 
“Well,” Liesel asked, “what is it?” 

Rudy pointed. “Look closer.” 

Gradually, they rode to a better position, behind a blue spruce tree. 
Through the prickly branches, Liesel noticed the closed window, and 
then the object leaning on the glass. 

“Ts that ...?” 
Rudy nodded. 

They debated the issue for many minutes before they agreed it 
needed to be done. It had obviously been placed there intentionally, 
and if it was a trap, it was worth it. 

Among the powdery blue branches, Liesel said, “A book thief would 
do it.” 

She dropped the bike, observed the street, and crossed the yard. 
The shadows of clouds were buried among the dusky grass. Were they 
holes for falling into, or patches of extra darkness for hiding in? Her 
imagination sent her sliding down one of those holes into the evil 
clutches of the mayor himself. If nothing else, those thoughts 
distracted her and she was at the window even quicker than she’d 
hoped. 

It was like The Whistler all over again. 
Her nerves licked her palms. 
Small streams of sweat rippled under her arms. 

When she raised her head, she could read the title. The Complete 
Duden Dictionary and Thesaurus. Briefly, she turned to Rudy and 
mouthed the words, It’s a dictionary. He shrugged and held out his 
arms. 

She worked methodically, sliding the window upward, wondering 
how all of this would look from inside the house. She envisioned the 
sight of her thieving hand reaching up, making the window rise until 
the book was felled. It seemed to surrender slowly, like a falling tree. 
Got it. 

There was barely a disturbance or sound. 

The book simply tilted toward her and she took it with her free 
hand. She even closed the window, nice and smooth, then turned and 
walked back across the potholes of clouds. 

“Nice,” Rudy said as he gave her the bike. 
“Thank you.” 

They rode toward the corner, where the day’s importance reached 
them. Liesel knew. It was that feeling again, of being watched. A 
voice pedaled inside her. Two laps. 

Look at the window. Look at the window. 
She was compelled. 

Like an itch that demands a fingernail, she felt an intense desire to 
stop. 

She placed her feet on the ground and turned to face the mayor’s 
house and the library window, and she saw. Certainly, she should 
have known this might happen, but she could not hide the shock that 
loitered inside when she witnessed the mayor’s wife, standing behind 
the glass. She was transparent, but she was there. Her fluffy hair was 
as it always was, and her wounded eyes and mouth and expression 
held themselves up, for viewing. 

Very slowly, she lifted her hand to the book thief on the street. A 
motionless wave. 

In her state of shock, Liesel said nothing, to Rudy or herself. She 
only steadied herself and raised her hand to acknowledge the mayor’s 
wife, in the window.

On the way home, they stopped at the bridge and inspected the heavy 
black book. As Rudy flipped through the pages, he arrived at a letter. 
He picked it up and looked slowly toward the book thief. “It’s got 
your name on it.” 

The river ran. 
Liesel took hold of the paper. 

e ¢ ¢ THE LETTER « « « 
Dear Liesel, 

I know you find me pathetic and loathsome (look that word 
up if you don’t know it), but I must tell you that I am not so 
stupid as to not see your footprints in the library. When I 
noticed the first book missing, I thought I had simply misplaced 
it, but then I saw the outlines of some feet on the floor in certain 
patches of the light. 

It made me smile. 

I was glad that you took what was rightfully yours. I then 
made the mistake of thinking that would be the end of it. 

When you came back, I should have been angry, but I wasn’t. 
I could hear you the last time, but I decided to leave you alone. 
You only ever take one book, and it will take a thousand visits 
till all of them are gone. My only hope is that one day you will 
knock on the front door and enter the library in the more 
civilized manner. 

Again, I am sorry we could no longer keep your foster mother 
employed. 
Lastly, I hope you find this dictionary and thesaurus useful as 
you read your stolen books. 

Yours sincerely, 

Ilsa Hermann 

“We'd better head home,” Rudy suggested, but Liesel did not go. 
“Can you wait here for ten minutes?” 
“Of course.” 

Liesel struggled back up to 8 Grande Strasse and sat on the familiar 
territory of the front entrance. The book was with Rudy, but she held 
the letter and rubbed her fingers on the folded paper as the steps 
grew heavier around her. She tried four times to knock on the 
daunting flesh of the door, but she could not bring herself to do it. 
The most she could accomplish was to place her knuckles gently on 
the warmness of the wood. 

Again, her brother found her. 

From the bottom of the steps, his knee healing nicely, he said, 
“Come on, Liesel, knock.” 

As she made her second getaway, she could soon see the distant 
figure of Rudy at the bridge. The wind showered through her hair. 
Her feet swam with the pedals. 

Liesel Meminger was a criminal. 

But not because she’d stolen a handful of books through an open 
window. 

You should have knocked, she thought, and although there was a 
good portion of guilt, there was also the juvenile trace of laughter. 

As she rode, she tried to tell herself something. 
You don’t deserve to be this happy, Liesel. You really don’t. 

Can a person steal happiness? Or is it just another internal, infernal 
human trick? 

Liesel shrugged away from her thoughts. She crossed the bridge 
and told Rudy to hurry up and not to forget the book. 

They rode home on rusty bikes. 

They rode home a couple of miles, from summer to autumn, and 
from a quiet night to the noisy breath of the bombing of Munich. 

THE SOUND OF SIRENS 

With the small collection of money Hans had earned in the summer, 
he brought home a secondhand radio. “This way,” he said, “we can 
hear when the raids are coming even before the sirens start. They 
make a cuckoo sound and then announce the regions at risk.” 

He placed it on the kitchen table and switched it on. They also tried 
to make it work in the basement, for Max, but there was nothing but 
static and severed voices in the speakers. 

In September, they did not hear it as they slept. 

Either the radio was already half broken, or it was swallowed 
immediately by the crying sound of sirens. 

A hand was shoved gently at Liesel’s shoulder as she slept. 
Papa’s voice followed it in, afraid. 
“Liesel, wake up. We have to go.” 

There was the disorientation of interrupted sleep, and Liesel could 
barely decipher the outline of Papa’s face. The only thing truly visible 
was his voice. 

In the hallway, they stopped. 
“Wait,” said Rosa. 

Through the dark, they rushed to the basement. 
The lamp was lit. 
Max edged out from behind the paint cans and drop sheets. His face 

was tired and he hitched his thumbs nervously into his pants. “Time 
to go, huh?” 
Hans walked to him. “Yes, time to go.” He shook his hand and 
slapped his arm. “We'll see you when we get back, right?” 

“Of course.” 
Rosa hugged him, as did Liesel. 
“Goodbye, Max.” 

Weeks earlier, they’d discussed whether they should all stay together 
in their own basement or if the three of them should go down the 
road, to a family by the name of Fiedler. It was Max who convinced 
them. “They said it’s not deep enough here. I’ve already put you in 
enough danger.” 

Hans had nodded. “It’s a shame we can’t take you with us. It’s a 
disgrace.” 

“Tt’s how it is.” 

Outside, the sirens howled at the houses, and the people came 
running, hobbling, and recoiling as they exited their homes. Night 
watched. Some people watched it back, trying to find the tin-can 
planes as they drove across the sky. 

Himmel Street was a procession of tangled people, all wrestling 
with their most precious possessions. In some cases, it was a baby. In 
others, a stack of photo albums or a wooden box. Liesel carried her 
books, between her arm and her ribs. Frau Holtzapfel was heaving a 
suitcase, laboring on the footpath with bulbous eyes and small- 
stepped feet. 

Papa, who’d forgotten everything—even his accordion—rushed 
back to her and rescued the suitcase from her grip. “Jesus, Mary, and 
Joseph, what have you got in here?” he asked. “An anvil?” 

Frau Holtzapfel advanced alongside him. “The necessities.” 

The Fiedlers lived six houses down. They were a family of four, all 
with wheat-colored hair and good German eyes. More important, they 
had a nice, deep basement. Twenty-two people crammed themselves 
into it, including the Steiner family, Frau Holtzapfel, Pfiffikus, a 
young man, and a family named Jenson. In the interest of a civil 
environment, Rosa Hubermann and Frau Holtzapfel were kept 
separated, though some things were above petty arguments. 
One light globe dangled from the ceiling and the room was dank 
and cold. Jagged walls jutted out and poked people in the back as 
they stood and spoke. The muffled sound of sirens leaked in from 
somewhere. They could hear a distorted version of them that 
somehow found a way inside. Although creating considerable 
apprehension about the quality of the shelter, at least they could hear 
the three sirens that would signal the end of the raid and safety. They 
didn’t need a Luftschutzwart—an air-raid supervisor. 

It wasn’t long before Rudy found Liesel and was standing next to 
her. His hair was pointing at something on the ceiling. “Isn’t this 
great?” 

She couldn’t resist some sarcasm. “It’s lovely.” 

“Ah, come on, Liesel, don’t be like that. What’s the worst that can 
happen, apart from all of us being flattened or fried or whatever 
bombs do?” 

Liesel looked around, gauging the faces. She started compiling a list 
of who was most afraid. 

e e e THE HIT LIST « « « 
1. Frau Holtzapfel 
2. Mr. Fiedler 
3. The young man 

4. Rosa Hubermann 

Frau Holtzapfel’s eyes were trapped open. Her wiry frame was 

stooped forward, and her mouth was a circle. Herr Fiedler busied 
himself by asking people, sometimes repeatedly, how they were 
feeling. The young man, Rolf Schultz, kept to himself in the corner, 
speaking silently at the air around him, castigating it. His hands were 
cemented into his pockets. Rosa rocked back and forth, ever so 
gently. “Liesel,” she whispered, “come here.” She held the girl from 
behind, tightening her grip. She sang a song, but it was so quiet that 
Liesel could not make it out. The notes were born on her breath, and 
they died at her lips. Next to them, Papa remained quiet and 
motionless. At one point, he placed his warm hand on Liesel’s cool 
skull. You'll live, it said, and it was right. 

To their left, Alex and Barbara Steiner stood with the younger of 
their children, Emma and Bettina. The two girls were attached to 
their mother’s right leg. The oldest boy, Kurt, stared ahead in a 
perfect Hitler Youth stance, holding the hand of Karin, who was tiny, 
even for her seven years. The ten-year-old, Anna-Marie, played with 
the pulpy surface of the cement wall. 

On the other side of the Steiners were Pfiffikus and the Jenson 
family. 
Pfiffikus kept himself from whistling. 

The bearded Mr. Jenson held his wife tightly, and their two kids 
drifted in and out of silence. Occasionally they pestered each other, 
but they held back when it came to the beginning of true argument. 

After ten minutes or so, what was most prominent in the cellar was 
a kind of nonmovement. Their bodies were welded together and only 
their feet changed position or pressure. Stillness was shackled to their 
faces. They watched each other and waited.

Angst—Fear: 
An unpleasant, often strong 
emotion caused by anticipation 
or awareness of danger. 

Related words: terror, horror, 
panic, fright, alarm. 

From other shelters, there were stories of singing “Deutschland tiber 
Alles” or of people arguing amid the staleness of their own breath. No 
such things happened in the Fiedler shelter. In that place, there was 
only fear and apprehension, and the dead song at Rosa Hubermann’s 
cardboard lips. 

Not long before the sirens signaled the end, Alex Steiner—the man 
with the immovable, wooden face—coaxed the kids from his wife’s 
legs. He was able to reach out and grapple for his son’s free hand. 
Kurt, still stoic and full of stare, took it up and tightened his grip 
gently on the hand of his sister. Soon, everyone in the cellar was 
holding the hand of another, and the group of Germans stood in a 
lumpy circle. The cold hands melted into the warm ones, and in some 
cases, the feeling of another human pulse was transported. It came 
through the layers of pale, stiffened skin. Some of them closed their 
eyes, waiting for their final demise, or hoping for a sign that the raid 
was finally over. 

Did they deserve any better, these people? 

How many had actively persecuted others, high on the scent of 
Hitler’s gaze, repeating his sentences, his paragraphs, his opus? Was 
Rosa Hubermann responsible? The hider of a Jew? Or Hans? Did they 
all deserve to die? The children? 

The answer to each of these questions interests me very much, 
though I cannot allow them to seduce me. I only know that all of 
those people would have sensed me that night, excluding the 
youngest of the children. I was the suggestion. I was the advice, my 
imagined feet walking into the kitchen and down the corridor. 

As is often the case with humans, when I read about them in the 
book thief’s words, I pitied them, though not as much as I felt for the 
ones I scooped up from various camps in that time. The Germans in 
basements were pitiable, surely, but at least they had a chance. That 

basement was not a washroom. They were not sent there for a 
shower. For those people, life was still achievable. 

In the uneven circle, the minutes soaked by. 
Liesel held Rudy’s hand, and her mama’s. 
Only one thought saddened her. 
Max. 
How would Max survive if the bombs arrived on Himmel Street? 

Around her, she examined the Fiedlers’ basement. It was much 
sturdier and considerably deeper than the one at 33 Himmel Street. 

Silently, she asked her papa. 
Are you thinking about him, too? 

Whether the silent question registered or not, he gave the girl a 
quick nod. It was followed a few minutes later by the three sirens of 
temporary peace. 

The people at 45 Himmel Street sank with relief. 
Some clenched their eyes and opened them again. 
A cigarette was passed around. 

Just as it made its way to Rudy Steiner’s lips, it was snatched away 
by his father. “Not you, Jesse Owens.” 

The children hugged their parents, and it took many minutes for all 
of them to fully realize that they were alive, and that they were going 
to be alive. Only then did their feet climb the stairs, to Herbert 
Fiedler’s kitchen. 

Outside, a procession of people made its way silently along the 
street. Many of them looked up and thanked God for their lives. 

When the Hubermanns made it home, they headed directly to the 
basement, but it seemed that Max was not there. The lamp was small 
and orange and they could not see him or hear an answer. 

“Max?” 
“He’s disappeared.” 
“Max, are you there?” 

“Pm here.” 

They originally thought the words had come from behind the drop 
sheets and paint cans, but Liesel was first to see him, in front of them. 
His jaded face was camouflaged among the painting materials and 
fabric. He was sitting there with stunned eyes and lips. 

When they walked across, he spoke again. 
“I couldn’t help it,” he said. 

It was Rosa who replied. She crouched down to face him. “What 
are you talking about, Max?” 

“T ...” He struggled to answer. “When everything was quiet, I went 
up to the corridor and the curtain in the living room was open just a 
crack .... I could see outside. I watched, only for a few seconds.” He 
had not seen the outside world for twenty-two months. 

There was no anger or reproach. 
It was Papa who spoke. 
“How did it look?” 

Max lifted his head, with great sorrow and great astonishment. 
“There were stars,” he said. “They burned my eyes.” 

Four of them. 
Two people on their feet. The other two remained seated. 
All had seen a thing or two that night. 

This place was the real basement. This was the real fear. Max 
gathered himself and stood to move back behind the sheets. He 
wished them good night, but he didn’t make it beneath the stairs. 

With Mama’s permission, Liesel stayed with him till morning, reading 
A Song in the Dark as he sketched and wrote in his book. 

From a Himmel Street window, he wrote, the stars set fire to my eyes. 

THE SKY STEALER 

The first raid, as it turned out, was not a raid at all. Had people 
waited to see the planes, they would have stood there all night. That 
accounted for the fact that no cuckoo had called from the radio. The 
Molching Express reported that a certain flak tower operator had 
become a little overexcited. He’d sworn that he could hear the rattle 
of planes and see them on the horizon. He sent the word. 

“He might have done it on purpose,” Hans Hubermann pointed out. 
“Would you want to sit in a flak tower, shooting up at planes carrying 
bombs?” 

Sure enough, as Max continued reading the article in the basement, 
it was reported that the man with the outlandish imagination had 
been stood down from his original duty. His fate was most likely 
some sort of service elsewhere. 

“Good luck to him,” Max said. He seemed to understand as he 
moved on to the crossword. 

The next raid was real. 

On the night of September 19, the cuckoo called from the radio, 
and it was followed by a deep, informative voice. It listed Molching as 
a possible target. 

Again, Himmel Street was a trail of people, and again, Papa left his 
accordion. Rosa reminded him to take it, but he refused. “I didn’t take 
it last time,” he explained, “and we lived.” War clearly blurred the 
distinction between logic and superstition. 

Eerie air followed them down to the Fiedlers’ basement. “I think it’s 
real tonight,” said Mr. Fiedler, and the children quickly realized that 
their parents were even more afraid this time around. Reacting the 
only way they knew, the youngest of them began to wail and cry as 

the room seemed to swing. 

Even from the cellar, they could vaguely hear the tune of bombs. 
Air pressure shoved itself down like a ceiling, as if to mash the earth. 
A bite was taken of Molching’s empty streets. 

Rosa held furiously on to Liesel’s hand. 
The sound of crying children kicked and punched. 

Even Rudy stood completely erect, feigning nonchalance, tensing 
himself against the tension. Arms and elbows fought for room. Some 
of the adults tried to calm the infants. Others were unsuccessful in 
calming themselves. 

“Shut that kid up!” Frau Holtzapfel clamored, but her sentence was 
just another hapless voice in the warm chaos of the shelter. Grimy 
tears were loosened from children’s eyes, and the smell of night 
breath, underarm sweat, and overworn clothes was stirred and stewed 
in what was now a cauldron swimming with humans. 

Although they were right next to each other, Liesel was forced to 
call out, “Mama?” Again, “Mama, you’re squashing my hand!” 

“What?” 
“My hand!” 

Rosa released her, and for comfort, to shut out the din of the 
basement, Liesel opened one of her books and began to read. The 
book on top of the pile was The Whistler and she spoke it aloud to 
help her concentrate. The opening paragraph was numb in her ears. 

“What did you say?” Mama roared, but Liesel ignored her. She 
remained focused on the first page. 

When she turned to page two, it was Rudy who noticed. He paid 
direct attention to what Liesel was reading, and he tapped his brother 
and his sisters, telling them to do the same. Hans Hubermann came 
closer and called out, and soon, a quietness started bleeding through 
the crowded basement. By page three, everyone was silent but Liesel. 

She didn’t dare to look up, but she could feel their frightened eyes 
hanging on to her as she hauled the words in and breathed them out. 
A voice played the notes inside her. This, it said, is your accordion. 

The sound of the turning page carved them in half. 
Liesel read on. 

For at least twenty minutes, she handed out the story. The youngest 
kids were soothed by her voice, and everyone else saw visions of the 
whistler running from the crime scene. Liesel did not. The book thief 
saw only the mechanics of the words—their bodies stranded on the 
paper, beaten down for her to walk on. Somewhere, too, in the gaps 
between a period and the next capital letter, there was also Max. She 
remembered reading to him when he was sick. Is he in the basement? 
she wondered. Or is he stealing a glimpse of the sky again? 

e e «A NICE THOUGHT « « « 
One was a book thief. 
The other stole the sky. 

Everyone waited for the ground to shake. 

That was still an immutable fact, but at least they were distracted 
now, by the girl with the book. One of the younger boys 
contemplated crying again, but Liesel stopped at that moment and 
imitated her papa, or even Rudy for that matter. She winked at him 
and resumed. 

Only when the sirens leaked into the cellar again did someone 
interrupt her. “We’re safe,” said Mr. Jenson. 
“Shhh!” said Frau Holtzapfel. 
Liesel looked up. “There are only two paragraphs till the end of the 

chapter,” she said, and she continued reading with no fanfare or 
added speed. Just the words.

Wort—Word:

Related words: term,

Out of respect, the adults kept everyone quiet, and Liesel finished 
chapter one of The Whistler. 

On their way up the stairs, the children rushed by her, but many of 
the older people—even Frau Holtzapfel, even Pfiffikus (how 
appropriate, considering the title she read from)—thanked the girl for 
the distraction. They did so as they made their way past and hurried 
from the house to see if Himmel Street had sustained any damage. 

Himmel Street was untouched. 

The only sign of war was a cloud of dust migrating from east to 
west. It looked through the windows, trying to find a way inside, and 
as it simultaneously thickened and spread, it turned the trail of 
humans into apparitions. 

There were no people on the street anymore. 
They were rumors carrying bags. 

At home, Papa told Max all about it. “There’s fog and ash—I think 
they let us out too early.” He looked to Rosa. “Should I go out? To see 
if they need help where the bombs dropped?” 

Rosa was not impressed. “Don’t be so idiotic,” she said. “You'll 
choke on the dust. No, no, Saukerl, you’re staying here.” A thought 
came to her. She looked at Hans very seriously now. In fact, her face 
was crayoned with pride. “Stay here and tell him about the girl.” Her 

voice loudened, just slightly. “About the book.” 
Max gave her some added attention. 

“The Whistler,” Rosa informed him. “Chapter one.” She explained 
exactly what had happened in the shelter. 

As Liesel stood in a corner of the basement, Max watched her and 
rubbed a hand along his jaw. Personally, I think that was the moment 
he conceived the next body of work for his sketchbook. 

The Word Shaker. 

He imagined the girl reading in the shelter. He must have watched 
her literally handing out the words. However, as always, he must also 
have seen the shadow of Hitler. He could probably already hear his 
footsteps coming toward Himmel Street and the basement, for later. 

After a lengthy pause, he looked ready to speak, but Liesel beat him 
to it. 

“Did you see the sky tonight?” 

“No.” Max looked at the wall and pointed. On it, they all watched 
the words and the picture he’d painted more than a year earlier—the 
rope and the dripping sun. “Only that one tonight,” and from there, 
no more was spoken. Nothing but thoughts. 

Max, Hans, and Rosa I cannot account for, but I know that Liesel 
Meminger was thinking that if the bombs ever landed on Himmel 
Street, not only did Max have less chance of survival than everyone 
else, but he would die completely alone. 

FRAU HOLTZAPFEL’S OFFER 

In the morning, the damage was inspected. No one died, but two 
apartment blocks were reduced to pyramids of rubble, and Rudy’s 
favorite Hitler Youth field had an enormous bowl spooned out of it. 
Half the town stood around its circumference. People estimated its 
depth, to compare it with their shelters. Several boys and girls spat 
into it. 
Rudy was standing next to Liesel. “Looks like they need to fertilize 
again.” 

When the next few weeks were raid-free, life almost returned to 
normal. Two telling moments, however, were on their way. 

e e ¢ THE DUAL EVENTS « « « 
OF OCTOBER 
The hands of Frau Holtzapfel. 
The parade of Jews. 

Her wrinkles were like slander. Her voice was akin to a beating with 
a stick. 

It was actually quite fortunate that they saw Frau Holtzapfel 
coming from the living room window, for her knuckles on the door 
were hard and decisive. They meant business. 

Liesel heard the words she dreaded. 

“You go and answer it,” Mama said, and the girl, knowing only too 
well what was good for her, did as she was told. 

“Is your mama home?” Frau Holtzapfel inquired. Constructed of 
fifty-year-old wire, she stood on the front step, looking back every so 

often to view the street. “Is that swine of a mother of yours here 
today?” 

Liesel turned and called out.

A chance for advancement or progress.

Soon, Rosa was behind her. “What do you want here? You want to 
spit on my kitchen floor now, too?” 

Frau Holtzapfel was not deterred in the slightest. “Is that how you 
greet everyone who shows up at your front door? What a G’sindel.” 

Liesel watched. She was unfortunate enough to be sandwiched 
between them. Rosa pulled her out of the way. “Well, are you going 
to tell me why you’re here or not?” 

Frau Holtzapfel looked once more at the street and back. “I have an 
offer for you.” 

Mama shifted her weight. “Is that right?” 

“No, not you.” She dismissed Rosa with a shrug of the voice and 
focused now on Liesel. “You.” 

“Why did you ask for me, then?” 
“Well, I at least need your permission.” 

Oh, Maria, Liesel thought, this is all I need. What the hell can 
Holtzapfel want with me? 

“T liked that book you read in the shelter.” 
No. You're not getting it. Liesel was convinced of that. “Yes?” 

“I was hoping to hear the rest of it in the shelter, but it looks like 
we're safe for now.” She rolled her shoulders and straightened the 

wire in her back. “So I want you to come to my place and read it to 
me.” 

“You’ve got some nerve, Holtzapfel.” Rosa was deciding whether to 
be furious or not. “If you think—” 

“Tl stop spitting on your door,” she interrupted. “And Ill give you 
my coffee ration.” 

Rosa decided against being furious. “And some flour?” 

“What, are you a Jew? Just the coffee. You can swap the coffee 
with someone else for the flour.” 

It was decided. 
By everyone but the girl. 
“Good, then, it’s done.” 
“Mama?” 

“Quiet, Saumensch. Go and get the book.” Mama faced Frau 
Holtzapfel again. “What days suit you?” 

“Monday and Friday, four o’clock. And today, right now.” 

Liesel followed the regimented footsteps to Frau Holtzapfel’s lodging 
next door, which was a mirror image of the Hubermanns’. If anything, 
it was slightly larger. 

When she sat down at the kitchen table, Frau Holtzapfel sat directly 
in front of her but faced the window. “Read,” she said. 

“Chapter two?” 

“No, chapter eight. Of course chapter two! Now get reading before I 
throw you out.” 

“Yes, Frau Holtzapfel.” 

“Never mind the ‘yes, Frau Holtzapfels.’ Just open the book. We 
don’t have all day.” 

Good God, Liesel thought. This is my punishment for all that 
stealing. It’s finally caught up with me. 

She read for forty-five minutes, and when the chapter was finished, a 
bag of coffee was deposited on the table. 

“Thank you,” the woman said. “It’s a good story.” She turned 
toward the stove and started on some potatoes. Without looking back, 
she said, “Are you still here, are you?” 

Liesel took that as her cue to leave. “Danke schon, Frau Holtzapfel.” 
By the door, when she saw the framed photos of two young men in 
military uniform, she also threw in a “heil Hitler,” her arm raised in 
the kitchen. 
“Yes.” Frau Holtzapfel was proud and afraid. Two sons in Russia. 
“Heil Hitler.” She put her water down to boil and even found the 
manners to walk the few steps with Liesel to the front door. “Bis 
morgen?” 

The next day was Friday. “Yes, Frau Holtzapfel. Until tomorrow.” 

Liesel calculated that there were four more reading sessions like that 
with Frau Holtzapfel before the Jews were marched through 
Molching. 

They were going to Dachau, to concentrate. 

That makes two weeks, she would later write in the basement. Two 
weeks to change the world, and fourteen days to ruin it. 

THE LONG WALK TO DACHAU 

Some people said that the truck had broken down, but I can 
personally testify that this was not the case. I was there. 

What had happened was an ocean sky, with whitecap clouds. 

Also, there was more than just the one vehicle. Three trucks don’t 
all break down at once. 

When the soldiers pulled over to share some food and cigarettes 
and to poke at the package of Jews, one of the prisoners collapsed 
from starvation and sickness. I have no idea where the convoy had 
traveled from, but it was perhaps four miles from Molching, and 
many steps more to the concentration camp at Dachau. 

I climbed through the windshield of the truck, found the diseased 
man, and jumped out the back. His soul was skinny. His beard was a 
ball and chain. My feet landed loudly in the gravel, though not a 
sound was heard by a soldier or prisoner. But they could all smell me. 

Recollection tells me that there were many wishes in the back of 
that truck. Inner voices called out to me. 

Why him and not me? 
Thank God it isn’t me. 

The soldiers, on the other hand, were occupied with a different 
discussion. The leader squashed his cigarette and asked the others a 
smoggy question. “When was the last time we took these rats for 
some fresh air?” 

His first lieutenant choked back a cough. “They could sure use it, 
couldn’t they?” 

“Well, how about it, then? We’ve got time, don’t we?” 
“We’ve always got time, sir.” 
“And it’s perfect weather for a parade, don’t you think?” 

“It is, sir.” 
“So what are you waiting for?” 

On Himmel Street, Liesel was playing soccer when the noise arrived. 
Two boys were fighting for the ball in the midfield when everything 
stopped. Even Tommy Miller could hear it. “What is that?” he asked 
from his position in goal. 

Everyone turned toward the sound of shuffling feet and regimented 
voices as they made their way closer. 

“Ts that a herd of cows?” Rudy asked. “It can’t be. It never sounds 
quite like that, does it?” 

Slowly at first, the street of children walked toward the magnetic 
sound, up toward Frau Diller’s. Once in a while there was added 
emphasis in the shouting. 

In a tall apartment just around the corner on Munich Street, an old 
lady with a foreboding voice deciphered for everyone the exact 
source of the commotion. Up high, in the window, her face appeared 
like a white flag with moist eyes and an open mouth. Her voice was 
like suicide, landing with a clunk at Liesel’s feet. 

She had gray hair. 
The eyes were dark, dark blue. 
“Die Juden,” she said. “The Jews.”

More people appeared on the street, where a collection of Jews and 
other criminals had already been shoved past. Perhaps the death 
camps were kept secret, but at times, people were shown the glory of 
a labor camp like Dachau. 

Far up, on the other side, Liesel spotted the man with his paint cart. 
He was running his hand uncomfortably through his hair. 

“Up there,” she pointed out to Rudy. “My papa.” 

They both crossed and made their way up, and Hans Hubermann 
attempted at first to take them away. “Liesel,” he said. “Maybe ...” 

He realized, however, that the girl was determined to stay, and 
perhaps it was something she should see. In the breezy autumn air, he 
stood with her. He did not speak. 

On Munich Street, they watched. 
Others moved in around and in front of them. 

They watched the Jews come down the road like a catalog of 
colors. That wasn’t how the book thief described them, but I can tell 
you that that’s exactly what they were, for many of them would die. 
They would each greet me like their last true friend, with bones like 
smoke and their souls trailing behind. 

When they arrived in full, the noise of their feet throbbed on top of 
the road. Their eyes were enormous in their starving skulls. And the 
dirt. The dirt was molded to them. Their legs staggered as they were 
pushed by soldiers’ hands—a few wayward steps of forced running 
before the slow return to a malnourished walk. 

Hans watched them above the heads of the crowding audience. I’m 
sure his eyes were silver and strained. Liesel looked through the gaps 
or over shoulders. 

The suffering faces of depleted men and women reached across to 
them, pleading not so much for help—they were beyond that—but for 
an explanation. Just something to subdue this confusion. 

Their feet could barely rise above the ground. 

Stars of David were plastered to their shirts, and misery was 
attached to them as if assigned. “Don’t forget your misery ...” In some 
cases, it grew on them like a vine. 

At their side, the soldiers also made their way past, ordering them 
to hurry up and to stop moaning. Some of those soldiers were only 
boys. They had the Fuhrer in their eyes. 

As she watched all of this, Liesel was certain that these were the 
poorest souls alive. That’s what she wrote about them. Their gaunt 
faces were stretched with torture. Hunger ate them as they continued 
forward, some of them watching the ground to avoid the people on 
the side of the road. Some looked appealingly at those who had come 
to observe their humiliation, this prelude to their deaths. Others 
pleaded for someone, anyone, to step forward and catch them in their 
arms. 

No one did. 

Whether they watched this parade with pride, temerity, or shame, 
nobody came forward to interrupt it. Not yet. 

Once in a while a man or woman—no, they were not men and 
women; they were Jews—would find Liesel’s face among the crowd. 
They would meet her with their defeat, and the book thief could do 
nothing but watch them back in a long, incurable moment before they 
were gone again. She could only hope they could read the depth of 
sorrow in her face, to recognize that it was true, and not fleeting. 

I have one of you in my basement! she wanted to say. We built a 
snowman together! I gave him thirteen presents when he was sick! 

Liesel said nothing at all. 
What good would it be? 

She understood that she was utterly worthless to these people. They 
could not be saved, and in a few minutes, she would see what would 
happen to those who might try to help them. 

In a small gap in the procession, there was a man, older than the 
others. 

He wore a beard and torn clothes. 

His eyes were the color of agony, and weightless as he was, he was 
too heavy for his legs to carry. 

Several times, he fell. 
The side of his face was flattened against the road. 

On each occasion, a soldier stood above him. “Steh’ auf,” he called 
down. “Stand up.” 

The man rose to his knees and fought his way up. He walked on. 

Every time he caught up sufficiently to the back of the line, he 
would soon lose momentum and stumble again to the ground. There 
were more behind him—a good truck’s worth—and they threatened 
to overtake and trample him. 

The ache in his arms was unbearable to watch as they shook, trying 
to lift his body. They gave way one more time before he stood and 
took another group of steps. 

He was dead. 
The man was dead. 

Just give him five more minutes and he would surely fall into the 
German gutter and die. They would all let him, and they would all 
watch. 

Then, one human. 
Hans Hubermann. 

It happened so quickly. 

The hand that held firmly on to Liesel’s let it drop to her side as the 
man came struggling by. She felt her palm slap her hip. 

Papa reached into his paint cart and pulled something out. He 
made his way through the people, onto the road. 

The Jew stood before him, expecting another handful of derision, 
but he watched with everyone else as Hans Hubermann held his hand 
out and presented a piece of bread, like magic. 

When it changed hands, the Jew slid down. He fell to his knees and 
held Papa’s shins. He buried his face between them and thanked him. 

Liesel watched. 

With tears in her eyes, she saw the man slide farther forward, 
pushing Papa back to cry into his ankles. 

Other Jews walked past, all of them watching this small, futile 
miracle. They streamed by, like human water. That day, a few would 
reach the ocean. They would be handed a white cap. 

Wading through, a soldier was soon at the scene of the crime. He 
studied the kneeling man and Papa, and he looked at the crowd. After 
another moment’s thought, he took the whip from his belt and began. 

The Jew was whipped six times. On his back, his head, and his legs. 
“You filth! You swine!” Blood dripped now from his ear. 

Then it was Papa’s turn. 

A new hand held Liesel’s now, and when she looked in horror next 
to her, Rudy Steiner swallowed as Hans Hubermann was whipped on 
the street. The sound sickened her and she expected cracks to appear 
on her papa’s body. He was struck four times before he, too, hit the 
ground. 

When the elderly Jew climbed to his feet for the last time and 
continued on, he looked briefly back. He took a last sad glance at the 
man who was kneeling now himself, whose back was burning with 
four lines of fire, whose knees were aching on the road. If nothing 
else, the old man would die like a human. Or at least with the 
thought that he was a human. 

Me? 
I’m not so sure if that’s such a good thing. 

When Liesel and Rudy made it through and helped Hans to his feet, 
there were so many voices. Words and sunlight. That’s how she 
remembered it. The light sparkling on the road and the words like 
waves, breaking on her back. Only as they walked away did they 
notice the bread sitting rejected on the street. 

As Rudy attempted to pick it up, a passing Jew snatched it from his 
hand and another two fought him for it as they continued on their 
way to Dachau. 

Silver eyes were pelted then. 
A cart was turned over and paint flowed onto the street. 
They called him a Jew lover. 
Others were silent, helping him back to safety. 

Hans Hubermann leaned forward, arms outstretched against a house 
wall. He was suddenly overwhelmed by what had just happened. 

There was an image, fast and hot. 
33 Himmel Street—its basement. 

Thoughts of panic were caught between the in-and-out struggle of 
his breath. 

They’ll come now. They’ll come. 
Oh, Christ, oh, crucified Christ. 
He looked at the girl and closed his eyes. 
“Are you hurt, Papa?” 
She received questions rather than an answer. 

“What was I thinking?” His eyes closed tighter and opened again. 
His overalls creased. There was paint and blood on his hands. And 
bread crumbs. How different from the bread of summer. “Oh my God, 
Liesel, what have I done?” 

Yes. 
I must agree. 

What had Papa done? 

PEACE 

At just after 11 p.m. that same night, Max Vandenburg walked up 
Himmel Street with a suitcase full of food and warm clothes. German 
air was in his lungs. The yellow stars were on fire. When he made it 
to Frau Diller’s, he looked back one last time to number thirty-three. 
He could not see the figure in the kitchen window, but she could see 
him. She waved and he did not wave back. 

Liesel could still feel his mouth on her forehead. She could smell 
his breath of goodbye. 

“T have left something for you,” he’d said, “but you will not get it 
until you’re ready.” 

He left. 
“Max?” 
But he did not come back. 
He had walked from her room and silently shut the door. 
The hallway murmured. 
He was gone. 

When she made it to the kitchen, Mama and Papa stood with 
crooked bodies and preserved faces. They’d been standing like that 
for thirty seconds of forever.

Somewhere near Munich, a German Jew was making his way through 
the darkness. An arrangement had been made to meet Hans 
Hubermann in four days (that is, if he wasn’t taken away). It was at a 
place far down the Amper, where a broken bridge leaned among the 
river and trees. 

He would make it there, but he would not stay longer than a few 
minutes. 

The only thing to be found there when Papa arrived four days later 
was a note under a rock, at the base of a tree. It was addressed to 
nobody and contained only one sentence. 

e e ¢e THE LAST WORDS OF « « « 
MAX VANDENBURG 
You’ve done enough. 

Now more than ever, 33 Himmel Street was a place of silence, and it 
did not go unnoticed that the Duden Dictionary was completely and 
utterly mistaken, especially with its related words. 

Silence was not quiet or calm, and it was not peace. 

THE IDIOT AND THE COAT MEN 

On the night of the parade, the idiot sat in the kitchen, drinking bitter 
gulps of Holtzapfel’s coffee and hankering for a cigarette. He waited 
for the Gestapo, the soldiers, the police—for anyone—to take him 
away, as he felt he deserved. Rosa ordered him to come to bed. The 
girl loitered in the doorway. He sent them both away and spent the 
hours till morning with his head in his hands, waiting. 

Nothing came. 

Every unit of time carried with it the expected noise of knocking 
and threatening words. 

They did not come. 
The only sound was of himself. 
“What have I done?” he whispered again. 
“God, Pd love a cigarette,” he answered. He was all out. 

Liesel heard the repeated sentences several times, and it took a lot 
to stay by the door. She’d have loved to comfort him, but she had 
never seen a man so devastated. There were no consolations that 
night. Max was gone, and Hans Hubermann was to blame. 

The kitchen cupboards were the shape of guilt, and his palms were 
oily with the memory of what he’d done. They must be sweaty, Liesel 
thought, for her own hands were soaked to the wrists. 

In her room, she prayed. 
Hands and knees, forearms against the mattress. 
“Please, God, please let Max survive. Please, God, please ...” 
Her suffering knees. 
Her painful feet. 

When first light appeared, she awoke and made her way back to the 
kitchen. Papa was asleep with his head parallel to the tabletop, and 
there was some saliva at the corner of his mouth. The smell of coffee 
was overpowering, and the image of Hans Hubermann’s stupid 
kindness was still in the air. It was like a number or an address. 
Repeat it enough times and it sticks. 

Her first attempt to wake him was unfelt, but her second nudge of 
the shoulder brought his head from the table in an upward shock. 

“Are they here?” 
“No, Papa, it’s me.” 
He finished the stale pool of coffee in his mug. His Adam’s apple 

lifted and sank. “They should have come by now. Why haven’t they 
come, Liesel?” 

It was an insult. 

They should have come by now and swept through the house, 
looking for any evidence of Jew loving or treason, but it appeared 
that Max had left for no reason at all. He could have been asleep in 
the basement or sketching in his book. 

“You can’t have known that they wouldn’t come, Papa.” 

“T should have known not to give the man some bread. I just didn’t 
think.” 

“Papa, you did nothing wrong.” 
“T don’t believe you.” 

He stood and walked out the kitchen door, leaving it ajar. Lending 
even more insult to injury, it was going to be a lovely morning. 

When four days had elapsed, Papa walked a long length of the Amper 
River. He brought back a small note and placed it on the kitchen 
table. 

Another week passed, and still, Hans Hubermann waited for his 

punishment. The welts on his back were turning to scars, and he 
spent the majority of his time walking around Molching. Frau Diller 
spat at his feet. Frau Holtzapfel, true to her word, had ceased spitting 
at the Hubermanns’ door, but here was a handy replacement. “I knew 
it,” the shopkeeper damned him. “You dirty Jew lover.” 

He walked obliviously on, and Liesel would often catch him at the 
Amper River, on the bridge. His arms rested on the rail and he leaned 
his upper body over the edge. Kids on bikes rushed past him, or they 
ran with loud voices and the slaps of feet on wood. None of it moved 
him in the slightest.

“Do you see him?” he asked her one afternoon, when she leaned with 
him. “In the water there?” 

The river was not running very fast. In the slow ripples, Liesel 
could see the outline of Max Vandenburg’s face. She could see his 
feathery hair and the rest of him. “He used to fight the Fuhrer in our 
basement.” 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” Papa’s hands tightened on the splintery 
wood. “I’m an idiot.” 

No, Papa. 
You're just a man. 

The words came to her more than a year later, when she wrote in 
the basement. She wished she’d thought of them at the time. 

“I am stupid,” Hans Hubermann told his foster daughter. “And 

kind. Which makes the biggest idiot in the world. The thing is, I want 
them to come for me. Anything’s better than this waiting.” 

Hans Hubermann needed vindication. He needed to know that Max 
Vandenburg had left his house for good reason. 

Finally, after nearly three weeks of waiting, he thought his moment 
had come. 

It was late. 

Liesel was returning from Frau Holtzapfel’s when she saw the two 
men in their long black coats, and she ran inside. 

“Papa, Papa!” She nearly wiped out the kitchen table. “Papa, 
they’re here!” 

Mama came first. “What’s all this shouting about, Saumensch? 
Who’s here?” 

“The Gestapo.” 
“Hansi!” 
He was already there, and he walked out of the house to greet 
them. Liesel wanted to join him, but Rosa held her back and they 
watched from the window. 
Papa was poised at the front gate. He fidgeted. 
Mama tightened her grip on Liesel’s arms. 

The men walked past. 

Papa looked back at the window, alarmed, then made his way out of 
the gate. He called after them. “Hey! I’m right here. It’s me you want. 
I live in this one.” 

The coat men only stopped momentarily and checked their 
notebooks. “No, no,” they told him. Their voices were deep and 
bulky. “Unfortunately, you’re a little old for our purposes.” 

They continued walking, but they did not travel very far, stopping 
at number thirty-five and proceeding through the open gate. 

“Frau Steiner?” they asked when the door was opened. 
“Yes, that’s right.” 
“We’ve come to talk to you about something.” 

The coat men stood like jacketed columns on the threshold of the 
Steiners’ shoe-box house. 

For some reason, they’d come for the boy. 
The coat men wanted Rudy. 

PART EIGHT 

the word shaker 

featuring: 
dominoes and darkness—the thought of 
rudy naked—punishment—a promise keeper’s 
wife—a collector—the bread eaters— 
a candle in the trees—a hidden sketchbook— 

and the anarchist’s suit collection 

DOMINOES AND DARKNESS 

In the words of Rudy’s youngest sisters, there were two monsters 
sitting in the kitchen. Their voices kneaded methodically at the door 
as three of the Steiner children played dominoes on the other side. 
The remaining three listened to the radio in the bedroom, oblivious. 
Rudy hoped this had nothing to do with what had happened at school 
the previous week. It was something he had refused to tell Liesel and 
did not talk about at home. 

e e «A GRAY AFTERNOON, « « « 
A SMALL SCHOOL OFFICE 
Three boys stood in a line. Their records 
and bodies were thoroughly examined. 

When the fourth game of dominoes was completed, Rudy began to 
stand them up in lines, creating patterns that wound their way across 
the living room floor. As was his habit, he also left a few gaps, in case 
the rogue finger of a sibling interfered, which it usually did. 
“Can I knock them down, Rudy?” 
“No.” 
“What about me?” 
“No. We all will.” 
He made three separate formations that led to the same tower of 
dominoes in the middle. Together, they would watch everything that 
was so carefully planned collapse, and they would all smile at the 
beauty of destruction. 
The kitchen voices were becoming louder now, each heaping itself 
upon the other to be heard. Different sentences fought for attention 

until one person, previously silent, came between them. 

“No,” she said. It was repeated. “No.” Even when the rest of them 
resumed their arguments, they were silenced again by the same voice, 
but now it gained momentum. “Please,” Barbara Steiner begged them. 
“Not my boy.” 

“Can we light a candle, Rudy?” 

It was something their father had often done with them. He would 
turn out the light and they’d watch the dominoes fall in the 
candlelight. It somehow made the event grander, a greater spectacle. 

His legs were aching anyway. “Let me find a match.” 

The light switch was at the door. 

Quietly, he walked toward it with the matchbox in one hand, the 
candle in the other. 

From the other side, the three men and one woman climbed to the 
hinges. “The best scores in the class,” said one of the monsters. Such 
depth and dryness. “Not to mention his athletic ability.” Damn it, why 
did he have to win all those races at the carnival? 

Deutscher. 
Damn that Franz Deutscher! 
But then he understood. 

This was not Franz Deutscher’s fault, but his own. He’d wanted to 
show his past tormentor what he was capable of, but he also wanted 
to prove himself to everyone. Now everyone was in the kitchen. 

He lit the candle and switched off the light. 
“Ready?” 

“But Pve heard what happens there.” That was the unmistakable, 
oaky voice of his father. 

“Come on, Rudy, hurry up.” 
“Yes, but understand, Herr Steiner, this is all for a greater purpose. 
Think of the opportunities your son can have. This is really a 
privilege.” 
“Rudy, the candle’s dripping.” 
He waved them away, waiting again for Alex Steiner. He came. 

“Privileges? Like running barefoot through the snow? Like jumping 
from ten-meter platforms into three feet of water?” 

Rudy’s ear was pressed to the door now. Candle wax melted onto 
his hand. 

“Rumors.” The arid voice, low and matter-of-fact, had an answer 
for everything. “Our school is one of the finest ever established. It’s 
better than world-class. We’re creating an elite group of German 
citizens in the name of the Fuhrer. ...” 

Rudy could listen no longer. 

He scraped the candle wax from his hand and drew back from the 
splice of light that came through the crack in the door. When he sat 
down, the flame went out. Too much movement. Darkness flowed in. 
The only light available was a white rectangular stencil, the shape of 
the kitchen door. 

He struck another match and reignited the candle. The sweet smell 
of fire and carbon. 

Rudy and his sisters each tapped a different domino and they 
watched them fall until the tower in the middle was brought to its 
knees. The girls cheered. 

Kurt, his older brother, arrived in the room. 
“They look like dead bodies,” he said. 
“What?” 

Rudy peered up at the dark face, but Kurt did not answer. He’d 
noticed the arguing from the kitchen. “What’s going on in there?” 

It was one of the girls who answered. The youngest, Bettina. She 
was five. “There are two monsters,” she said. “They’ve come for 
Rudy.” 

Again, the human child. So much cannier. 

Later, when the coat men left, the two boys, one seventeen, the other 
fourteen, found the courage to face the kitchen. 

They stood in the doorway. The light punished their eyes. 
It was Kurt who spoke. “Are they taking him?” 
Their mother’s forearms were flat on the table. Her palms were 
facing up. 
Alex Steiner raised his head. 
It was heavy. 
His expression was sharp and definite, freshly cut. 

A wooden hand wiped at the splinters of his fringe, and he made 
several attempts to speak. 

“Papa?” 
But Rudy did not walk toward his father. 

He sat at the kitchen table and took hold of his mother’s facing-up 
hand. 
Alex and Barbara Steiner would not disclose what was said while 
the dominoes were falling like dead bodies in the living room. If only 
Rudy had kept listening at the door, just for another few minutes ... 
He told himself in the weeks to come—or in fact, pleaded with 
himself—that if he’d heard the rest of the conversation that night, 
he’d have entered the kitchen much earlier. “I'll go,” he’d have said. 
“Please, take me, I’m ready now.” 

If he’d intervened, it might have changed everything. 

s e e THREE POSSIBILITIES « « « 

1. Alex Steiner wouldn’t have suffered the same punishment as 
Hans Hubermann. 
2. Rudy would have gone away to school. 

3. And just maybe, he would have lived. 

The cruelty of fate, however, did not allow Rudy Steiner to enter the 
kitchen at the opportune moment. 

He’d returned to his sisters and the dominoes. 
He sat down. 
Rudy Steiner wasn’t going anywhere. 

THE THOUGHT OF RUDY NAKED 

There had been a woman. 
Standing in the corner. 

She had the thickest braid he’d ever seen. It roped down her back, 
and occasionally, when she brought it over her shoulder, it lurked at 
her colossal breast like an overfed pet. In fact, everything about her 
was magnified. Her lips, her legs. Her paved teeth. She had a large, 
direct voice. No time to waste. “Komm,” she instructed them. “Come. 
Stand here.” 

The doctor, by comparison, was like a balding rodent. He was small 
and nimble, pacing the school office with his manic yet businesslike 
movements and mannerisms. And he had a cold. 

Out of the three boys, it was difficult to decide which was the more 
reluctant to take off his clothes when ordered to do so. The first one 
looked from person to person, from the aging teacher to the 
gargantuan nurse to the pint-sized doctor. The one in the middle 
looked only at his feet, and the one on the far left counted his 
blessings that he was in the school office and not a dark alley. The 
nurse, Rudy decided, was a frightener. 

“Who’s first?” she asked. 

It was the supervising teacher, Herr Heckenstaller, who answered. 
He was more a black suit than a man. His face was a mustache. 
Examining the boys, his choice came swiftly. 
“Schwarz.” 
The unfortunate Jurgen Schwarz undid his uniform with great 
discomfort. He was left standing only in his shoes and underwear. A 
luckless plea was marooned on his German face. 

“And?” Herr Heckenstaller asked. “The shoes?” 

He removed both shoes, both socks. 

“Und die Unterhosen,” said the nurse. “And the underpants.” 

Both Rudy and the other boy, Olaf Spiegel, had started undressing 
now as well, but they were nowhere near the perilous position of 
Jurgen Schwarz. The boy was shaking. He was a year younger than 
the other two, but taller. When his underpants came down, it was 
with abject humiliation that he stood in the small, cool office. His 
self-respect was around his ankles. 

The nurse watched him with intent, her arms folded across her 
devastating chest. 

Heckenstaller ordered the other two to get moving. 

The doctor scratched his scalp and coughed. His cold was killing 
him. 

The three naked boys were each examined on the cold flooring. 

They cupped their genitals in their hands and shivered like the 
future. 

Between the doctor’s coughing and wheezing, they were put through 
their paces. 

“Breathe in.” Sniffle. 
“Breathe out.” Second sniffle. 
“Arms out now.” A cough. “I said arms out.” A horrendous hail of 
coughing. 
As humans do, the boys looked constantly at each other for some 
sign of mutual sympathy. None was there. All three pried their hands 

from their penises and held out their arms. Rudy did not feel like he 
was part of a master race. 

“We are gradually succeeding,” the nurse was informing the teacher, 
“in creating a new future. It will be a new class of physically and 
mentally advanced Germans. An officer class.” 

Unfortunately, her sermon was cut short when the doctor creased 
in half and coughed with all his might over the abandoned clothes. 
Tears welled up in his eyes and Rudy couldn’t help but wonder. 
A new future? Like him? 
Wisely, he did not speak it. 
The examination was completed and he managed to perform his 

first nude “heil Hitler.” In a perverse kind of way, he conceded that it 
didn’t feel half bad. 

Stripped of their dignity, the boys were allowed to dress again, and as 
they were shown from the office, they could already hear the 
discussion held in their honor behind them. 

“They’re a little older than usual,” the doctor said, “but I’m 
thinking at least two of them.” 

The nurse agreed. “The first and the third.” 

Three boys stood outside. 
First and third. 
“First was you, Schwarz,’ 
Spiegel. “Who was third?” 

Spiegel made a few calculations. Did she mean third in line or third 
examined? It didn’t matter. He knew what he wanted to believe. 
“That was you, I think.” 

? 

said Rudy. He then questioned Olaf 

“Cow shit, Spiegel, it was you.” 

e e e A SMALL GUARANTEE ¢ ¢ à 
The coat men knew who was third. 

The day after they’d visited Himmel Street, Rudy sat on his front step 
with Liesel and related the whole saga, even the smallest details. He 
gave up and admitted what had happened that day at school when he 

was taken out of class. There was even some laughter about the 
tremendous nurse and the look on Jiirgen Schwarz’s face. For the 
most part, though, it was a tale of anxiety, especially when it came to 
the voices in the kitchen and the dead-body dominoes. 

For days, Liesel could not shift one thought from her head. 

It was the examination of the three boys, or if she was honest, it 
was Rudy. 

She would lie in bed, missing Max, wondering where he was, 
praying that he was alive, but somewhere, standing among all of it, 
was Rudy. 
He glowed in the dark, completely naked. 

There was great dread in that vision, especially the moment when 
he was forced to remove his hands. It was disconcerting to say the 
least, but for some reason, she couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

PUNISHMENT 

On the ration cards of Nazi Germany, there was no listing for 
punishment, but everyone had to take their turn. For some it was 
death in a foreign country during the war. For others it was poverty 
and guilt when the war was over, when six million discoveries were 
made throughout Europe. Many people must have seen their 
punishments coming, but only a small percentage welcomed it. One 
such person was Hans Hubermann. 

You do not help Jews on the street. 
Your basement should not be hiding one. 

At first, his punishment was conscience. His oblivious unearthing of 
Max Vandenburg plagued him. Liesel could see it sitting next to his 
plate as he ignored his dinner, or standing with him at the bridge 
over the Amper. He no longer played the accordion. His silver-eyed 
optimism was wounded and motionless. That was bad enough, but it 
was only the beginning. 

One Wednesday in early November, his true punishment arrived in 
the mailbox. On the surface, it appeared to be good news. 

e e ¢ PAPER IN THE KITCHEN « « « 
We are delighted to inform you that your application to join the 
NSDAP has been approved .... 

“The Nazi Party?” Rosa asked. “I thought they didn’t want you.” 
“They didn’t.” 
Papa sat down and read the letter again. 

He was not being put on trial for treason or for helping Jews or 
anything of the sort. Hans Hubermann was being rewarded, at least as 

far as some people were concerned. How could this be possible? 
“There has to be more.” 

There was. 

On Friday, a statement arrived to say that Hans Hubermann was to 
be drafted into the German army. A member of the party would be 
happy to play a role in the war effort, it concluded. If he wasn’t, there 
would certainly be consequences. 

Liesel had just returned from reading with Frau Holtzapfel. The 
kitchen was heavy with soup steam and the vacant faces of Hans and 
Rosa Hubermann. Papa was seated. Mama stood above him as the 
soup started to burn. 

“God, please don’t send me to Russia,” Papa said. 
“Mama, the soup’s burning.” 
“What?” 

Liesel hurried across and took it from the stove. “The soup.” When 
she’d successfully rescued it, she turned and viewed her foster 
parents. Faces like ghost towns. “Papa, what’s wrong?” 

He handed her the letter and her hands began to shake as she made 
her way through it. The words had been punched forcefully into the 

paper. 

e e e THE CONTENTS OF « « « 
LIESEL MEMINGER’S IMAGINATION 
In the shell-shocked kitchen, somewhere near the stove, there’s 
an image of a lonely, overworked typewriter. It sits in a distant, 
near-empty room. Its keys are faded and a blank sheet waits 
patiently upright in the assumed position. It wavers slightly in 
the breeze from the window. Coffee break is nearly over. A pile 
of paper the height of a human stands casually by the door. It 

could easily be smoking. 

In truth, Liesel only saw the typewriter later, when she wrote. She 
wondered how many letters like that were sent out as punishment to 
Germany’s Hans Hubermanns and Alex Steiners—to those who helped 
the helpless, and those who refused to let go of their children. 

It was a sign of the German army’s growing desperation. 
They were losing in Russia. 
Their cities were being bombed. 

More people were needed, as were ways of attaining them, and in 
most cases, the worst possible jobs would be given to the worst 
possible people. 

As her eyes scanned the paper, Liesel could see through the punched 
letter holes to the wooden table. Words like compulsory and duty were 
beaten into the page. Saliva was triggered. It was the urge to vomit. 
“What is this?” 

Papa’s answer was quiet. “I thought I taught you to read, my girl.” 
He did not speak with anger or sarcasm. It was a voice of vacancy, to 
match his face. 

Liesel looked now to Mama. 

Rosa had a small rip beneath her right eye, and within the minute, 
her cardboard face was broken. Not down the center, but to the right. 
It gnarled down her cheek in an arc, finishing at her chin. 

e © ¢ TWENTY MINUTES LATER: « « « 
A GIRL ON HIMMEL STREET 
She looks up. She speaks in a whisper. “The sky is soft today, 
Max. The clouds are so soft and sad, and ...” She looks away and 
crosses her arms. She thinks of her papa going to war and grabs 
her jacket at each side of her body. “And it’s cold, Max. It’s so 

cold ....” 

Five days later, when she continued her habit of looking at the 
weather, she did not get a chance to see the sky. 

Next door, Barbara Steiner was sitting on the front step with her 
neatly combed hair. She was smoking a cigarette and shivering. On 
her way over, Liesel was interrupted by the sight of Kurt. He came 
out and sat with his mother. When he saw the girl stop, he called out. 

“Come on, Liesel. Rudy will be out soon.” 
After a short pause, she continued walking toward the step. 
Barbara smoked. 

A wrinkle of ash was teetering at the end of the cigarette. Kurt took 
it, ashed it, inhaled, then gave it back. 

When the cigarette was done, Rudy’s mother looked up. She ran a 
hand through her tidy lines of hair. 

“Our papa’s going, too,” Kurt said. 
Quietness then. 
A group of kids was kicking a ball, up near Frau Diller’s. 

“When they come and ask you for one of your children,” Barbara 
Steiner explained, to no one in particular, “you’re supposed to say 
yes.” 

THE PROMISE KEEPER’S WIFE 

e © ¢ THE BASEMENT, 9 A.M. « « « 
Six hours till goodbye: 
“I played an accordion, Liesel. Someone else’s.” He closes his 
eyes: “It brought the house down.” 

Not counting the glass of champagne the previous summer, Hans 
Hubermann had not consumed a drop of alcohol for a decade. Then 
came the night before he left for training. 

He made his way to the Knoller with Alex Steiner in the afternoon 
and stayed well into the evening. Ignoring the warnings of their 
wives, both men drank themselves into oblivion. It didn’t help that 
the Knoller’s owner, Dieter Westheimer, gave them free drinks. 

Apparently, while he was still sober, Hans was invited to the stage 
to play the accordion. Appropriately, he played the infamous 
“Gloomy Sunday”—the anthem of suicide from Hungary—and 
although he aroused all the sadness for which the song was 
renowned, he brought the house down. Liesel imagined the scene of 
it, and the sound. Mouths were full. Empty beer glasses were streaked 
with foam. The bellows sighed and the song was over. People 
clapped. Their beer-filled mouths cheered him back to the bar. 

When they managed to find their way home, Hans couldn’t get his 
key to fit the door. So he knocked. Repeatedly. 

“Rosa!” 
It was the wrong door. 
Frau Holtzapfel was not thrilled. 

“Schwein! You’re at the wrong house.” She rammed the words 
through the keyhole. “Next door, you stupid Saukerl.” 

“Thanks, Frau Holtzapfel.” 
“You know what you can do with your thanks, you asshole.” 
“Excuse me?” 
“Just go home.” 
“Thanks, Frau Holtzapfel.” 
“Didn’t I just tell you what you can do with your thanks?” 
“Did you?” 
(It’s amazing what you can piece together from a basement 
conversation and a reading session in a nasty old woman’s kitchen.) 
“Just get lost, will you!” 

When at long last he came home, Papa made his way not to bed, but 
to Liesel’s room. He stood drunkenly in the doorway and watched her 
sleep. She awoke and thought immediately that it was Max. 

“Ts it you?” she asked. 
“No,” he said. He knew exactly what she was thinking. “It’s Papa.” 

He backed out of the room and she heard his footsteps making their 
way down to the basement. 

In the living room, Rosa was snoring with enthusiasm. 

Close to nine o’clock the next morning, in the kitchen, Liesel was 
given an order by Rosa. “Hand me that bucket there.” 

She filled it with cold water and walked with it down to the 
basement. Liesel followed, in a vain attempt to stop her. “Mama, you 
can’t!” 

“Can’t I?” She faced her briefly on the steps. “Did I miss something, 
Saumensch? Do you give the orders around here now?” 

Both of them were completely still. 
No answer from the girl. 
“T thought not.” 

They continued on and found him on his back, among a bed of 
drop sheets. He felt he didn’t deserve Max’s mattress. 

“Now, let’s see”—Rosa lifted the bucket—“if he’s alive.” 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!” 

The watermark was oval-shaped, from halfway up his chest to his 
head. His hair was plastered to one side and even his eyelashes 
dripped. “What was that for?” 

“You old drunk!” 
“Jesus ...” 

Steam was rising weirdly from his clothes. His hangover was 
visible. It heaved itself to his shoulders and sat there like a bag of wet 
cement. 

Rosa swapped the bucket from left hand to right. “It’s lucky you’re 
going to the war,” she said. She held her finger in the air and wasn’t 
afraid to wave it. “Otherwise [d kill you myself, you know that, don’t 
you?” 

Papa wiped a stream of water from his throat. “Did you have to do 
that?” 

“Yes. I did.” She started up the steps. “If you’re not up there in five 
minutes, you get another bucketful.” 

Left in the basement with Papa, Liesel busied herself by mopping 
up the excess water with some drop sheets. 

Papa spoke. With his wet hand, he made the girl stop. He held her 
forearm. “Liesel?” His face clung to her. “Do you think he’s alive?” 

Liesel sat. 
She crossed her legs. 
The wet drop sheet soaked onto her knee. 
“T hope so, Papa.” 

It felt like such a stupid thing to say, so obvious, but there seemed 
little alternative. 

To say at least something of value, and to distract them from 
thoughts of Max, she made herself crouch and placed a finger in a 
small pool of water on the floor. “Guten Morgen, Papa.” 

In response, Hans winked at her. 

But it was not the usual wink. It was heavier, clumsier. The post- 
Max version, the hangover version. He sat up and told her about the 
accordion of the previous night, and Frau Holtzapfel. 

e © ¢ THE KITCHEN: 1 P.M. « « « 
Two hours till goodbye: “Don’t go, Papa. Please.” 
Her spoon-holding hand is shaking. “First we lost Max. 
I can’t lose you now, too.” In response, the hungover 
man digs his elbow into the table and covers his right eye. 
“You’re half a woman now, Liesel.” He wants to break down but 
wards it off. He rides through it. “Look after 
Mama, will you?” The girl can make only half a nod 
to agree. “Yes, Papa.” 

He left Himmel Street wearing his hangover and a suit. 

Alex Steiner was not leaving for another four days. He came over 
an hour before they left for the station and wished Hans all the best. 
The whole Steiner family had come. They all shook his hand. Barbara 
embraced him, kissing both cheeks. “Come back alive.” 

“Yes, Barbara,” and the way he’d said it was full of confidence. “Of 
course I will.” He even managed to laugh. “It’s just a war, you know. 
I’ve survived one before.” 

When they walked up Himmel Street, the wiry woman from next 
door came out and stood on the pavement. 

“Goodbye, Frau Holtzapfel. My apologies for last night.” 

“Goodbye, Hans, you drunken Saukerl,” but she offered him a note 
of friendship, too. “Come home soon.” 

“Yes, Frau Holtzapfel. Thank you.” 

She even played along a little. “You know what you can do with 
your thanks.” 

At the corner, Frau Diller watched defensively from her shop 
window and Liesel took Papa’s hand. She held it all the way along 
Munich Street, to the Bahnhof. The train was already there. 

They stood on the platform. 
Rosa embraced him first. 
No words. 
Her head was buried tightly into his chest, then gone. 
Then the girl. 

“Papa?” 
Nothing. 

Don’t go, Papa. Just don’t go. Let them come for you if you stay. 
But don’t go, please don’t go. 

“Papa? 99 

e e ¢ THE TRAIN STATION, 3 P.M. « « « 
No hours, no minutes till goodbye: 
He holds her. To say something, to say anything, 
he speaks over her shoulder. “Could you look after my 
accordion, Liesel? I decided not to take it.” 
Now he finds something he truly means. “And if 
there are more raids, keep reading in the shelter.” 
The girl feels the continued sign of her slightly 
growing chest. It hurts as it touches the bottom of his ribs. 
“Yes, Papa.” A millimeter from her eyes, she 
stares at the fabric of his suit. She speaks into 

him. “Will you play us something when you come home?” 

Hans Hubermann smiled at his daughter then and the train was ready 
to leave. He reached out and gently held her face in his hand. “I 
promise,” he said, and he made his way into the carriage. 

They watched each other as the train pulled away. 
Liesel and Rosa waved. 

Hans Hubermann grew smaller and smaller, and his hand held 
nothing now but empty air. 

On the platform, people disappeared around them until no one else 
was left. There was only the wardrobe-shaped woman and the 
thirteen-year-old girl. 

For the next few weeks, while Hans Hubermann and Alex Steiner 
were at their various fast-tracked training camps, Himmel Street was 
swollen. Rudy was not the same—he didn’t talk. Mama was not the 
same—she didn’t berate. Liesel, too, was feeling the effects. There 
was no desire to steal a book, no matter how much she tried to 
convince herself that it would cheer her up. 

After twelve days of Alex Steiner’s absence, Rudy decided he’d had 
enough. He hurried through the gate and knocked on Liesel’s door. 

“Kommst?” 
T a. 9 

She didn’t care where he was going or what he was planning, but he 
would not be going without her. They walked up Himmel, along 
Munich Street and out of Molching altogether. It was after 
approximately an hour that Liesel asked the vital question. Up till 
then, she’d only glanced over at Rudy’s determined face, or examined 
his stiff arms and the fisted hands in his pockets. 

“Where are we going?” 

“Isn’t it obvious?” 
She struggled to keep up. “Well, to tell you the truth—not really.” 
“Pm going to find him.” 
“Your papa?” 
“Yes.” He thought about it. “Actually, no. I think I'll find the Fuhrer 
instead.” 
Faster footsteps. “Why?” 

Rudy stopped. “Because I want to kill him.” He even turned on the 
spot, to the rest of the world. “Did you hear that, you bastards?” he 
shouted. “I want to kill the Führer!” 
They resumed walking and made it another few miles or so. That 
was when Liesel felt the urge to turn around. “It’ll be dark soon, 
Rudy.” 
He walked on. “So what?” 
“Pm going back.” 
Rudy stopped and watched her now as if she were betraying him. 
“That’s right, book thief. Leave me now. I bet if there was a lousy 
book at the end of this road, you’d keep walking. Wouldn’t you?” 
For a while, neither of them spoke, but Liesel soon found the will. 
“You think you’re the only one, Saukerl?” She turned away. “And you 
only lost your father ....” 
“What does that mean?” 
Liesel took a moment to count. 

Her mother. Her brother. Max Vandenburg. Hans Hubermann. All 
of them gone. And she’d never even had a real father. 

“Tt means,” she said, “I’m going home.” 

For fifteen minutes she walked alone, and even when Rudy arrived 
at her side with jogging breath and sweaty cheeks, not another word 
was said for more than an hour. They only walked home together 
with aching feet and tired hearts. 

There was a chapter called “Tired Hearts” in A Song in the Dark. A 

romantic girl had promised herself to a young man, but it appeared 
that he had run away with her best friend. Liesel was sure it was 
chapter thirteen. “ ‘My heart is so tired,’ ” the girl had said. She was 
sitting in a chapel, writing in her diary. 
No, thought Liesel as she walked. It’s my heart that is tired. A 
thirteen-year-old heart shouldn’t feel like this. 

When they reached the perimeter of Molching, Liesel threw some 
words across. She could see Hubert Oval. “Remember when we raced 
there, Rudy?” 

“Of course. I was just thinking about that myself—how we both 
fell.” 

“You said you were covered in shit.” 

“It was only mud.” He couldn’t hold his amusement now. “I was 
covered in shit at Hitler Youth. You’re getting mixed up, Saumensch.” 

“Pm not mixed up at all. I’m only telling you what you said. What 
someone says and what happened are usually two different things, 
Rudy, especially when it comes to you.” 

This was better. 

When they walked down Munich Street again, Rudy stopped and 
looked into the window of his father’s shop. Before Alex left, he and 
Barbara had discussed whether she should keep it running in his 
absence. They decided against it, considering that work had been 
slow lately anyway, and there was at least a partial threat of party 
members making their presence felt. Business was never good for 
agitators. The army pay would have to do. 

Suits hung from the rails and the mannequins held their ridiculous 
poses. “I think that one likes you,” Liesel said after a while. It was her 
way of telling him it was time to keep going. 
On Himmel Street, Rosa Hubermann and Barbara Steiner stood 
together on the footpath. 

“Oh, Maria,” Liesel said. “Do they look worried?” 

“They look mad.” 

There were many questions when they arrived, mainly of the “Just 
where in the hell have you two been?” nature, but the anger quickly 
gave way to relief. 

It was Barbara who pursued the answers. “Well, Rudy?” 

Liesel answered for him. “He was killing the Fiihrer,” she said, and 
Rudy looked genuinely happy for a long enough moment to please 
her. 

“Bye, Liesel.” 

Several hours later, there was a noise in the living room. It stretched 
toward Liesel in bed. She awoke and remained still, thinking ghosts 
and Papa and intruders and Max. There was the sound of opening and 
dragging, and then the fuzzy silence who followed. The silence was 
always the greatest temptation. 

Don’t move. 

She thought that thought many times, but she didn’t think it 
enough. 

Her feet scolded the floor. 
Air breathed up her pajama sleeves. 

She walked through the corridor darkness in the direction of silence 
that had once been noisy, toward the thread of moonlight standing in 
the living room. She stopped, feeling the bareness of her ankles and 
toes. She watched. 

It took longer than she expected for her eyes to adjust, and when 
they did, there was no denying the fact that Rosa Hubermann was 
sitting on the edge of the bed with her husband’s accordion tied to 
her chest. Her fingers hovered above the keys. She did not move. She 
didn’t even appear to be breathing. 

The sight of it propelled itself to the girl in the hallway.

Rosa with Accordion. 
Moonlight on Dark. 
D1” x Instrument x Silence. 

Liesel stayed and watched. 

Many minutes dripped past. The book thief’s desire to hear a note 
was exhausting, and still, it would not come. The keys were not 
struck. The bellows didn’t breathe. There was only the moonlight, like 
a long strand of hair in the curtain, and there was Rosa. 

The accordion remained strapped to her chest. When she bowed 
her head, it sank to her lap. Liesel watched. She knew that for the 
next few days, Mama would be walking around with the imprint of an 
accordion on her body. There was also an acknowledgment that there 
was great beauty in what she was currently witnessing, and she chose 
not to disturb it. 

She returned to bed and fell asleep to the vision of Mama and the 
silent music. Later, when she woke up from her usual dream and 
crept again to the hallway, Rosa was still there, as was the accordion. 
Like an anchor, it pulled her forward. Her body was sinking. She 
appeared dead. 
She can’t possibly be breathing in that position, Liesel thought, but 
when she made her way closer, she could hear it. 
Mama was snoring again. 

Who needs bellows, she thought, when you’ve got a pair of lungs 
like that? 

Eventually, when Liesel returned to bed, the image of Rosa 
Hubermann and the accordion would not leave her. The book thief’s 

eyes remained open. She waited for the suffocation of sleep. 

THE COLLECTOR 

Neither Hans Hubermann nor Alex Steiner was sent to fight. Alex was 
sent to Austria, to an army hospital outside Vienna. Given his 
expertise in tailoring, he was given a job that at least resembled his 
profession. Cartloads of uniforms and socks and shirts would come in 
every week and he would mend what needed mending, even if they 
could only be used as underclothes for the suffering soldiers in Russia. 

Hans was sent first, quite ironically, to Stuttgart, and later, to 
Essen. He was given one of the most undesirable positions on the 
home front. The LSE. 

s « eA NECESSARY EXPLANATION « « « 
LSE 
Luftwaffe Sondereinheit— 
Air Raid Special Unit 

The job of the LSE was to remain aboveground during air raids and 
put out fires, prop up the walls of buildings, and rescue anyone who 
had been trapped during the raid. As Hans soon discovered, there was 
also an alternative definition for the acronym. The men in the unit 
would explain to him on his first day that it really stood for 
Leichensammler Einheit—Dead Body Collectors. 

When he arrived, Hans could only guess what those men had done 
to deserve such a task, and in turn, they wondered the same of him. 
Their leader, Sergeant Boris Schipper, asked him straight out. When 
Hans explained the bread, the Jews, and the whip, the round-faced 
sergeant gave out a short spurt of laughter. “You’re lucky to be alive.” 
His eyes were also round and he was constantly wiping them. They 
were either tired or itchy or full of smoke and dust. “Just remember 

that the enemy here is not in front of you.” 

Hans was about to ask the obvious question when a voice arrived 
from behind. Attached to it was the slender face of a young man with 
a smile like a sneer. Reinhold Zucker. “With us,” he said, “the enemy 
isn’t over the hill or in any specific direction. It’s all around.” He 
returned his focus to the letter he was writing. “You'll see.” 

In the messy space of a few months, Reinhold Zucker would be 
dead. He would be killed by Hans Hubermann’s seat. 

As the war flew into Germany with more intensity, Hans would learn 
that every one of his shifts started in the same fashion. The men 
would gather at the truck to be briefed on what had been hit during 
their break, what was most likely to be hit next, and who was 
working with whom. 

Even when no raids were in operation, there would still be a great 
deal of work to be done. They would drive through broken towns, 
cleaning up. In the truck, there were twelve slouched men, all rising 
and falling with the various inconsistencies in the road. 

From the beginning, it was clear that they all owned a seat. 
Reinhold Zucker’s was in the middle of the left row. 

Hans Hubermann’s was at the very back, where the daylight 
stretched itself out. He learned quickly to be on the lookout for any 
rubbish that might be thrown from anywhere in the truck’s interior. 
Hans reserved a special respect for cigarette butts, still burning as 
they whistled by. 

e © eA COMPLETE LETTER HOME = « « 
To my dear Rosa and Liesel, 
Everything is fine here. 
I hope you are both well. 
With love, Papa 

In late November, he had his first smoky taste of an actual raid. The 
truck was mobbed by rubble and there was much running and 
shouting. Fires were burning and the ruined cases of buildings were 
piled up in mounds. Framework leaned. The smoke bombs stood like 
matchsticks in the ground, filling the city’s lungs. 

Hans Hubermann was in a group of four. They formed a line. 
Sergeant Boris Schipper was at the front, his arms disappearing into 
the smoke. Behind him was Kessler, then Brunnenweg, then 
Hubermann. As the sergeant hosed the fire, the other two men hosed 
the sergeant, and just to make sure, Hubermann hosed all three of 
them. 

Behind him, a building groaned and tripped. 

It fell face-first, stopping a few meters from his heels. The concrete 
smelled brand-new, and the wall of powder rushed at them. 

“Gottverdammt, Hubermann!” The voice struggled out of the flames. 
It was followed immediately by three men. Their throats were filled 
with particles of ash. Even when they made it around the corner, 
away from the center of the wreckage, the haze of the collapsed 
building attempted to follow. It was white and warm, and it crept 
behind them. 
Slumped in temporary safety, there was much coughing and 
swearing. The sergeant repeated his earlier sentiments. “Goddamn it, 
Hubermann.” He scraped at his lips to loosen them. “What the hell 
was that?” 

“Tt just collapsed, right behind us.” 
“That much I know already. The question is, how big was it? It 
must have been ten stories high.” 
“No, sir, just two, I think.” 

“Jesus.” A coughing fit. “Mary and Joseph.” Now he yanked at the 
paste of sweat and powder in his eye sockets. “Not much you could 
do about that.” 

One of the other men wiped his face and said, “Just once I want to 
be there when they hit a pub, for Christ’s sake. I’m dying for a beer.” 

Each man leaned back. 

They could all taste it, putting out the fires in their throats and 
softening the smoke. It was a nice dream, and an impossible one. 
They were all aware that any beer that flowed in these streets would 
not be beer at all, but a kind of milk shake or porridge. 

All four men were plastered with the  gray-and-white 
conglomeration of dust. When they stood up fully, to resume work, 
only small cracks of their uniform could be seen. 

The sergeant walked to Brunnenweg. He brushed heavily at his 
chest. Several smacks. “That’s better. You had some dust on there, my 
friend.” As Brunnenweg laughed, the sergeant turned to his newest 
recruit. “You first this time, Hubermann.” 

They put the fires out for several hours, and they found anything they 
could to convince a building to remain standing. In some cases, where 
the sides were damaged, the remaining edges poked out like elbows. 
This was Hans Hubermann’s strong point. He almost came to enjoy 
finding a smoldering rafter or disheveled slab of concrete to prop 
those elbows up, to give them something to rest on. 

His hands were packed tightly with splinters, and his teeth were 
caked with residue from the fallout. Both lips were set with moist 
dust that had hardened, and there wasn’t a pocket, a thread, or a 
hidden crease in his uniform that wasn’t covered in a film left by the 
loaded air. 

The worst part of the job was the people. 

Once in a while there was a person roaming doggedly through the 
fog, mostly single-worded. They always shouted a name. 

Sometimes it was Wolfgang. 
“Have you seen my Wolfgang?” 
Their handprints would remain on his jacket. 
“Stephanie!” 
“Hansi!” 

“Gustel! Gustel Stoboi!” 

As the density subsided, the roll call of names limped through the 
ruptured streets, sometimes ending with an ash-filled embrace or a 
knelt-down howl of grief. They accumulated, hour by hour, like sweet 
and sour dreams, waiting to happen. 

The dangers merged into one. Powder and smoke and the gusty 
flames. The damaged people. Like the rest of the men in the unit, 
Hans would need to perfect the art of forgetting. 

“How are you, Hubermann?” the sergeant asked at one point. Fire 
was at his shoulder. 

Hans nodded, uneasily, at the pair of them. 

Midway through the shift, there was an old man who staggered 
defenselessly through the streets. As Hans finished stabilizing a 
building, he turned to find him at his back, waiting calmly for his 
turn. A bloodstain was signed across his face. It trailed off down his 
throat and neck. He was wearing a white shirt with a dark red collar 
and he held his leg as if it was next to him. “Could you prop me up 
now, young man?” 

Hans picked him up and carried him out of the haze. 

e e e A SMALL, SAD NOTE « « « 
I visited that small city 
street with the man still in 
Hans Hubermann’s arms. 
The sky was white-horse gray. 

It wasn’t until he placed him down on a patch of concrete-coated 
grass that Hans noticed. 

“What is it?” one of the other men asked. 

Hans could only point. 
“Oh.” A hand pulled him away. “Get used to it, Hubermann.” 

For the rest of the shift, he threw himself into duty. He tried to ignore 
the distant echoes of calling people. 

After perhaps two hours, he rushed from a building with the 
sergeant and two other men. He didn’t watch the ground and tripped. 
Only when he returned to his haunches and saw the others looking in 
distress at the obstacle did he realize. 

The corpse was facedown. 
It lay in a blanket of powder and dust, and it was holding its ears. 

It was a boy. 
Perhaps eleven or twelve years old. 

Not far away, as they progressed along the street, they found a 
woman calling the name Rudolf. She was drawn to the four men and 
met them in the mist. Her body was frail and bent with worry. 

“Have you seen my boy?” 
“How old is he?” the sergeant asked. 
“Twelve.” 
Oh, Christ. Oh, crucified Christ. 

They all thought it, but the sergeant could not bring himself to tell 
her or point the way. 

As the woman tried to push past, Boris Schipper held her back. 
“We’ve just come from that street,” he assured her. “You won’t find 
him down there.” 

The bent woman still clung to hope. She called over her shoulder as 
she half walked, half ran. “Rudy!” 

Hans Hubermann thought of another Rudy then. The Himmel Street 

variety. Please, he asked into a sky he couldn’t see, let Rudy be safe. 
His thoughts naturally progressed to Liesel and Rosa and the Steiners, 
and Max. 

When they made it to the rest of the men, he dropped down and lay 
on his back. 

“How was it down there?” someone asked. 
Papa’s lungs were full of sky. 

A few hours later, when he’d washed and eaten and thrown up, he 
attempted to write a detailed letter home. His hands were 
uncontrollable, forcing him to make it short. If he could bring 
himself, the remainder would be told verbally, when and if he made 
it home. 

To my dear Rosa and Liesel, he began. 
It took many minutes to write those six words down. 

THE BREAD EATERS 

It had been a long and eventful year in Molching, and it was finally 
drawing to a close. 

Liesel spent the last few months of 1942 consumed by thoughts of 
what she called three desperate men. She wondered where they were 
and what they were doing. 

One afternoon, she lifted the accordion from its case and polished it 
with a rag. Only once, just before she put it away, did she take the 
step that Mama could not. She placed her finger on one of the keys 
and softly pumped the bellows. Rosa had been right. It only made the 
room feel emptier. 

Whenever she met Rudy, she asked if there had been any word 
from his father. Sometimes he described to her in detail one of Alex 
Steiner’s letters. By comparison, the one letter her own papa had sent 
was somewhat of a disappointment. 

Max, of course, was entirely up to her imagination. 

It was with great optimism that she envisioned him walking alone 
on a deserted road. Once in a while she imagined him falling into a 
doorway of safety somewhere, his identity card enough to fool the 
right person. 
The three men would turn up everywhere. 
She saw her papa in the window at school. Max often sat with her 
by the fire. Alex Steiner arrived when she was with Rudy, staring 
back at them after they’d slammed the bikes down on Munich Street 
and looked into the shop. 
“Look at those suits,” Rudy would say to her, his head and hands 
against the glass. “All going to waste.” 

Strangely, one of Liesel’s favorite distractions was Frau Holtzapfel. 
The reading sessions included Wednesday now as well, and they’d 
finished the water-abridged version of The Whistler and were on to 
The Dream Carrier. The old woman sometimes made tea or gave Liesel 
some soup that was infinitely better than Mama’s. Less watery. 

Between October and December, there had been one more parade of 
Jews, with one to follow. As on the previous occasion, Liesel had 
rushed to Munich Street, this time to see if Max Vandenburg was 
among them. She was torn between the obvious urge to see him—to 
know that he was still alive—and an absence that could mean any 
number of things, one of which being freedom. 

In mid-December, a small collection of Jews and other miscreants 
was brought down Munich Street again, to Dachau. Parade number 
three. 

Rudy walked purposefully down Himmel Street and returned from 
number thirty-five with a small bag and two bikes. 

“You game, Saumensch?” 

e e e THE CONTENTS OF RUDY’S BAG « « « 
Six stale pieces of bread, 
broken into quarters. 

They pedaled ahead of the parade, toward Dachau, and stopped at an 
empty piece of road. Rudy passed Liesel the bag. “Take a handful.” 

“Pm not sure this is a good idea.” 
He slapped some bread onto her palm. “Your papa did.” 
How could she argue? It was worth a whipping. 
“If we’re fast, we won’t get caught.” He started distributing the 

bread. “So move it, Saumensch.” 

Liesel couldn’t help herself. There was the trace of a grin on her 
face as she and Rudy Steiner, her best friend, handed out the pieces of 
bread on the road. When they were finished, they took their bikes and 
hid among the Christmas trees. 

The road was cold and straight. It wasn’t long till the soldiers came 
with the Jews. 

In the tree shadows, Liesel watched the boy. How things had 
changed, from fruit stealer to bread giver. His blond hair, although 
darkening, was like a candle. She heard his stomach growl—and he 
was giving people bread. 

Was this Germany? 
Was this Nazi Germany? 

The first soldier did not see the bread—he was not hungry—but the 
first Jew saw it. 

His ragged hand reached down and picked a piece up and shoved it 
deliriously to his mouth. 

Is that Max? Liesel thought. 
She could not see properly and moved to get a better view. 
“Hey!” Rudy was livid. “Don’t move. If they find us here and match 
us to the bread, we’re history.” 
Liesel continued. 
More Jews were bending down and taking bread from the road, 
and from the edge of the trees, the book thief examined each and 
every one of them. Max Vandenburg was not there. 
Relief was short-lived. 
It stirred itself around her just as one of the soldiers noticed a 
prisoner drop a hand to the ground. Everyone was ordered to stop. 
The road was closely examined. The prisoners chewed as fast and 

silently as they could. Collectively, they gulped. 
The soldier picked up a few pieces and studied each side of the 
road. The prisoners also looked. 
“In there!” 

One of the soldiers was striding over, to the girl by the closest trees. 
Next he saw the boy. Both began to run. 

They chose different directions, under the rafters of branches and 
the tall ceiling of the trees. 

99 
! 

“Don’t stop running, Liesel 
“What about the bikes?” 
“Scheiss drauf! Shit on them, who cares!” 
They ran, and after a hundred meters, the hunched breath of the 
soldier drew closer. It sidled up next to her and she waited for the 
accompanying hand. 
She was lucky. 
All she received was a boot up the ass and a fistful of words. “Keep 
running, little girl, you don’t belong here!” She ran and she did not 
stop for at least another mile. Branches sliced her arms, pinecones 
rolled at her feet, and the taste of Christmas needles chimed inside 
her lungs. 

A good forty-five minutes had passed by the time she made it back, 
and Rudy was sitting by the rusty bikes. He’d collected what was left 
of the bread and was chewing on a stale, stiff portion. 

“T told you not to get too close,” he said. 
She showed him her backside. “Have I got a footprint?” 

THE HIDDEN SKETCHBOOK 

A few days before Christmas, there was another raid, although 
nothing dropped on the town of Molching. According to the radio 
news, most of the bombs fell in open country. 

What was most important was the reaction in the Fiedlers’ shelter. 
Once the last few patrons had arrived, everyone settled down 
solemnly and waited. They looked at her, expectantly. 

Papa’s voice arrived, loud in her ears. 
“And if there are more raids, keep reading in the shelter.” 
Liesel waited. She needed to be sure that they wanted it. 
Rudy spoke for everyone. “Read, Saumensch.” 

She opened the book, and again, the words found their way upon 
all those present in the shelter. 

At home, once the sirens had given permission for everyone to return 
aboveground, Liesel sat in the kitchen with her mama. A 
preoccupation was at the forefront of Rosa Hubermann’s expression, 
and it was not long until she picked up a knife and left the room. 
“Come with me.” 

She walked to the living room and took the sheet from the edge of 
her mattress. In the side, there was a sewn-up slit. If you didn’t know 
beforehand that it was there, there was almost no chance of finding 
it. Rosa cut it carefully open and inserted her hand, reaching in the 
length of her entire arm. When it came back out, she was holding 
Max Vandenburg’s sketchbook. 

“He said to give this to you when you were ready,” she said. “I was 
thinking your birthday. Then I brought it back to Christmas.” Rosa 
Hubermann stood and there was a strange look on her face. It was not 

made up of pride. Perhaps it was the thickness, the heaviness of 
recollection. She said, “I think you’ve always been ready, Liesel. From 
the moment you arrived here, clinging to that gate, you were meant 
to have this.” 

Rosa gave her the book. 
The cover looked like this: 

e e e THE WORD SHAKER +% « « 
A Small Collection 
of Thoughts 
for Liesel Meminger 

Liesel held it with soft hands. She stared. “Thanks, Mama.” 
She embraced her. 

There was also a great longing to tell Rosa Hubermann that she 
loved her. It’s a shame she didn’t say it. 

She wanted to read the book in the basement, for old times’ sake, but 
Mama convinced her otherwise. “There’s a reason Max got sick down 
there,” she said, “and I can tell you one thing, girl, I’m not letting you 
get sick.” 

She read in the kitchen. 
Red and yellow gaps in the stove. 
The Word Shaker. 

She made her way through the countless sketches and stories, and the 
pictures with captions. Things like Rudy on a dais with three gold 
medals slung around his neck. Hair the color of lemons was written 
beneath it. The snowman made an appearance, as did a list of the 

thirteen presents, not to mention the records of countless nights in the 
basement or by the fire. 

Of course, there were many thoughts, sketches, and dreams relating 
to Stuttgart and Germany and the Ftihrer. Recollections of Max’s 
family were also there. In the end, he could not resist including them. 
He had to. 

Then came. 
That was where The Word Shaker itself made its appearance. 

It was a fable or a fairy tale. Liesel was not sure which. Even days 
later, when she looked up both terms in the Duden Dictionary, she 
couldn’t distinguish between the two. 

On the previous page, there was a small note. 

ee «PAGE 116¢<- 
Liesel—I almost scribbled this story out. I thought you might be 
too old for such a tale, but maybe no one is. I thought of you 
and your books and words, and this strange story came into my 
head. I hope you can find some good in it. 

She turned the page. 
THERE WAS once a strange, small man. He decided three important 
details about his life: 

1. He would part his hair from the opposite side to everyone else. 
2. He would make himself a small, strange mustache. 
3. He would one day rule the world. 

The young man wandered around for quite some time, thinking, planning, 
and figuring out exactly how to make the world his. Then one day, out of 
nowhere, it struck him—the perfect plan. He’d seen a mother walking with 
her child. At one point, she admonished the small boy, until finally, he 
began to cry. Within a few minutes, she spoke very softly to him, after 

which he was soothed and even smiled. 

The young man rushed to the woman and embraced her. “Words!” He 
grinned. 

“What?” 
But there was no reply. He was already gone. 

Yes, the Führer decided that he would rule the world with words. “I will 
never fire a gun,” he devised. “I will not have to.” Still, he was not rash. 
Let’s allow him at least that much. He was not a stupid man at all. His 
first plan of attack was to plant the words in as many areas of his 
homeland as possible. 

He planted them day and night, and cultivated them. 

He watched them grow, until eventually, great forests of words had risen 
throughout Germany .... It was a nation of farmed thoughts. 

WHILE THE words were growing, our young Führer also planted seeds to 
create symbols, and these, too, were well on their way to full bloom. Now 
the time had come. The Führer was ready. 

He invited his people toward his own glorious heart, beckoning them 
with his finest, ugliest words, handpicked from his forests. And the people 
came. 

They were all placed on a conveyor belt and run through a rampant 
machine that gave them a lifetime in ten minutes. Words were fed into 
them. Time disappeared and they now Knew everything they needed to 

know. They were hypnotized. 

Next, they were fitted with their symbols, and everyone was happy. 

Soon, the demand for the lovely ugly words and Symbols increased to such 
a point that as the forests grew, many people were needed to maintain 
them. Some were employed to climb the trees and throw the words down 
to those below. They were then fed directly into the remainder of the 
Fuhrer’s people, not to mention those who came back for more. 

The people who climbed the trees were called word shakers. 

THE BEST word shakers were the ones who understood the true power of 
words. They were the ones who could climb the highest. One such word 
shaker was a small, skinny girl. She was renowned as the best word shaker 
of her region because she knew how powerless a person could be 
WITHOUT words. 


That’s why she could climb higher than anyone else. She had desire. She 

was hungry for them. 

One day, however, she met a man who was despised by her homeland, 
even though he was born in it. They became good friends, and when the 
man was sick, the word shaker allowed a single teardrop to fall on his 
face. The tear was made of friendship—a single word—and it dried and 
became a seed, and when next the girl was in the forest, she planted that 
seed among the other trees. She watered it every day. 

At first, there was nothing, but one afternoon, when she checked it after a 
day of word-shaking, a small sprout had shot up. She stared at it for a 
long time. 

The tree grew every day, faster than everything else, till it was the tallest 
tree in the forest. Everyone came to look at it. They all whispered about it, 
and they waited... for the Fuhrer. 

Incensed, he immediately ordered the tree to be cut down. That was when 
the word shaker made her way through the crowd. She fell to her hands 
and knees. “Please,” she cried, “you can’t cut it down” 

The Führer, however, was unmoved. He could not afford to make 
exceptions. As the word shaker was dragged away, he turned to his right- 
hand man and made a request. “Ax, please” 

AT THAT moment, the word shaker twisted free. She ran. She boarded the 
tree, and even as the Führer hammered at the trunk with his ax, she 

climbed until she reached the highest of the branches. The voices and ax 
beats continued faintly on. Clouds walked by—like white monsters with 
gray hearts. Afraid but stubborn, the word shaker remained. She waited 
for the tree to fall. 

But the tree would not move. 

Many hours passed, and still, the Fuhrer’s ax could not take a single bite 
out of the trunk. In a state nearing collapse, he ordered another man to 
continue. 

/ | oN 

DAN 

Days passed. 
Weeks took over. 

A hundred and ninety-six soldiers could not make any impact on the 
word shaker’s tree. 

“But how does she eat?” the people asked. “How does she sleep?” 

What they didn’t know was that other word shakers threw supplies 
across, and the girl climbed down to the lower branches to collect them. 

IT SNOWED. It rained. Seasons came and went. The word shaker 

remained. 

When the last axman gave up, he called up to her. “Word shaker! You 
can come down now! There is no one who can defeat this tree!” 

The word shaker, who could only just make out the man’s sentences, 
replied with a whisper. She handed it down through the branches. «vo 
thank you,” she said, for she knew that it was only herself who was 
holding the tree upright. 

NO ONE knew how long it had taken, but one afternoon, a new axman 
walked into town. His bag looked too heavy for him. His eyes dragged. His 
feet drooped with exhaustion. “The tree,” he asked the people. “Where is 
the tree?” 

An audience followed him, and when he arrived, clouds had covered the 
highest regions of the branches. The word shaker could hear the people 
calling out that a new axman had come to put an end to her vigil. 
“She will not come down,” the people said, “for anyone.” 

They did not know who the axman was, and they did not know that he 
was undeterred. 


He opened his bag and pulled out something much smaller than an ax. 

The people laughed. They said, “You can’t chop a tree down with an old 
hammer!” 

The young man did not listen to them. He only looked through his bag 
for some nails. He placed three of them in his mouth and attempted to 

hammer a fourth one into the tree. The first branches were now extremely 
high and he estimated that he needed four nails to use as footholds to 
reach them. 

“Look at this idiot,” roared one of the watching men. «no one else could 
chop it down with an ax, and this fool thinks he can do it with—” 
The man fell silent. 

THE FIRST nail entered the tree and was held steady after five blows. 
Then the second went in, and the young man started to climb. 

By the fourth nail, he was up in the arms and continued on his way. He 
was tempted to call out as he did so, but he decided against it. 

The climb seemed to last for miles. It took many hours for him to reach 
the final branches, and when he did, he found the word shaker asleep in 
her blankets and the clouds. 

He watched her for many minutes. 
The warmth of the sun heated the cloudy rooftop. 
He reached down, touching her arm, and the word shaker woke up. 
She rubbed her eyes, and after a long study of his face, she spoke. 
“Ts it really you?” 

Is it from your cheek, she thought, that I took the seed? The man 
nodded. 

His heart wobbled and he held tighter to the branches. “It is.” 

TOGETHER, THEY stayed in the summit of the tree. They waited for the 
clouds to disappear, and when they did, they could see the rest of the 
forest. 

“It wouldn’t stop growing,” she explained. 

“But neither would this.” The young man looked at the branch that held 
his hand. He had a point. 

When they had looked and talked enough, they made their way back 
down. They left the blankets and remaining food behind. 

The people could not believe what they were seeing, and the moment the 
word shaker and the young man set foot in the world, the tree finally 
began to show the ax marks. Bruises appeared. Slits were made in the 
trunk and the earth began to shiver. 

“It’s going to fall!” a young woman screamed. “The tree is going to fall!” 
She was right. The word shaker’s tree, in all its miles and miles of height, 
slowly began to tip. It moaned as it was sucked to the ground. The world 
shook, and when everything finally settled, the tree was laid out among the 

rest of the forest. It could never destroy all of it, but if nothing else, a 
different-colored path was carved through it. 

The word shaker and the young man climbed up to the horizontal trunk. 
They navigated the branches and began to walk. When they looked back, 
they noticed that the majority of onlookers had started to return to their 
own places. In there. Out there. In the forest. 

But as they walked on, they stopped several times, to listen. They 
thought they could hear voices and words behind them, on the word 
shaker’s tree. 

For a long time, Liesel sat at the kitchen table and wondered where 
Max Vandenburg was, in all that forest out there. The light lay down 
around her. She fell asleep. Mama made her go to bed, and she did so, 
with Max’s sketchbook against her chest. 

It was hours later, when she woke up, that the answer to her question 
came. “Of course,” she whispered. “Of course I know where he is,” 
and she went back to sleep. 

She dreamed of the tree. 

THE ANARCHIST’S SUIT COLLECTION 

e ¢ © 35 HIMMEL STREET, « « « 
DECEMBER 24 
With the absence of two fathers, 
the Steiners have invited Rosa 
and Trudy Hubermann, and Liesel. 
When they arrive, Rudy is still in 
the process of explaining his 
clothes. He looks at Liesel and his 
mouth widens, but only slightly. 

The days leading up to Christmas 1942 fell thick and heavy with 
snow. Liesel went through The Word Shaker many times, from the 
story itself to the many sketches and commentaries on either side of 
it. On Christmas Eve, she made a decision about Rudy. To hell with 
being out too late. 
She walked next door just before dark and told him she had a 
present for him, for Christmas. 
Rudy looked at her hands and either side of her feet. “Well, where 
the hell is it?” 

“Forget it, then.” 

But Rudy knew. He’d seen her like this before. Risky eyes and 
sticky fingers. The breath of stealing was all around her and he could 
smell it. “This gift,” he estimated. “You haven’t got it yet, have you?” 

“No.” 
“And yow’re not buying it, either.” 
“Of course not. Do you think I have any money?” Snow was still 

falling. At the edge of the grass, there was ice like broken glass. “Do 
you have the key?” she asked. 

“The key to what?” But it didn’t take Rudy long to understand. He 
made his way inside and returned not long after. In the words of 
Viktor Chemmel, he said, “It’s time to go shopping.” 

The light was disappearing fast, and except for the church, all of 
Munich Street had closed up for Christmas. Liesel walked hurriedly to 
remain in step with the lankier stride of her neighbor. They arrived at 
the designated shop window. sTEINER—SCHNEIDERMEISTER. The glass wore a 
thin sheet of mud and grime that had blown onto it in the passing 
weeks. On the opposite side, the mannequins stood like witnesses. 
They were serious and ludicrously stylish. It was hard to shake the 
feeling that they were watching everything. 

Rudy reached into his pocket. 
It was Christmas Eve. 
His father was near Vienna. 

He didn’t think he’d mind if they trespassed in his beloved shop. 
The circumstances demanded it. 

The door opened fluently and they made their way inside. Rudy’s first 
instinct was to hit the light switch, but the electricity had already 
been cut off. 

“Any candles?” 

Rudy was dismayed. “I brought the key. And besides, this was your 
idea.” 

In the middle of the exchange, Liesel tripped on a bump in the 
floor. A mannequin followed her down. It groped her arm and 
dismantled in its clothes on top of her. “Get this thing off me!” It was 
in four pieces. The torso and head, the legs, and two separate arms. 
When she was rid of it, Liesel stood and wheezed. “Jesus, Mary.” 

Rudy found one of the arms and tapped her on the shoulder with its 
hand. When she turned in fright, he extended it in friendship. “Nice 
to meet you.” 

For a few minutes, they moved slowly through the tight pathways 
of the shop. Rudy started toward the counter. When he fell over an 
empty box, he yelped and swore, then found his way back to the 
entrance. “This is ridiculous,” he said. “Wait here a minute.” Liesel 
sat, mannequin arm in hand, till he returned with a lit lantern from 
the church. 
A ring of light circled his face. 
“So where’s this present you’ve been bragging about? It better not 
be one of these weird mannequins.” 
“Bring the light over.” 
When he made it to the far left section of the shop, Liesel took the 
lantern with one hand and swept through the hanging suits with the 
other. She pulled one out but quickly replaced it with another. “No, 
still too big.” After two more attempts, she held a navy blue suit in 
front of Rudy Steiner. “Does this look about your size?” 

While Liesel sat in the dark, Rudy tried on the suit behind one of the 
curtains. There was a small circle of light and the shadow dressing 
itself. 

When he returned, he held out the lantern for Liesel to see. Free of 
the curtain, the light was like a pillar, shining onto the refined suit. It 
also lit up the dirty shirt beneath and Rudy’s battered shoes. 

“Well?” he asked. 

Liesel continued the examination. She moved around him and 
shrugged. “Not bad.” 

“Not bad! I look better than just not bad.” 
“The shoes let you down. And your face.” 

Rudy placed the lantern on the counter and came toward her in 
mock-anger, and Liesel had to admit that a nervousness started 

gripping her. It was with both relief and disappointment that she 

watched him trip and fall on the disgraced mannequin. 
On the floor, Rudy laughed. 
Then he closed his eyes, clenching them hard. 

Liesel rushed over. 
She crouched above him. 
Kiss him, Liesel, kiss him. 
“Are you all right, Rudy? Rudy?” 

“T miss him,” said the boy, sideways, across the floor. 

“Frohe Weihnachten,” Liesel replied. She helped him 
straightening the suit. “Merry Christmas.”

PART NINE 

the last human stranger 

featuring: 
the next temptation—a cardplayer— 
the snows of stalingrad—an ageless 
brother—an accident—the bitter taste 
of questions—a toolbox, a bleeder, 
a bear—a broken plane— 

and a homecoming 

THE NEXT TEMPTATION 

This time, there were cookies. 
But they were stale. 

They were Kipferl left over from Christmas, and they’d been sitting 
on the desk for at least two weeks. Like miniature horseshoes with a 
layer of icing sugar, the ones on the bottom were bolted to the plate. 
The rest were piled on top, forming a chewy mound. She could 
already smell them when her fingers tightened on the window ledge. 
The room tasted like sugar and dough, and thousands of pages. 
There was no note, but it didn’t take Liesel long to realize that Ilsa 
Hermann had been at it again, and she certainly wasn’t taking the 
chance that the cookies might not be for her. She made her way back 
to the window and passed a whisper through the gap. The whisper’s 
name was Rudy. 
They’d gone on foot that day because the road was too slippery for 
bikes. The boy was beneath the window, standing watch. When she 
called out, his face appeared, and she presented him with the plate. 
He didn’t need much convincing to take it. 
His eyes feasted on the cookies and he asked a few questions. 
“Anything else? Any milk?” 
“What?” 
“Milk,” he repeated, a little louder this time. If he’d recognized the 
offended tone in Liesel’s voice, he certainly wasn’t showing it. 
The book thief’s face appeared above him again. “Are you stupid? 
Can I just steal the book?” 

“Of course. All ’'m saying is ...” 

Liesel moved toward the far shelf, behind the desk. She found some 
paper and a pen in the top drawer and wrote Thank you, leaving the 

note on top. 

To her right, a book protruded like a bone. Its paleness was almost 
scarred by the dark lettering of the title. Die Letzte Menschliche Fremde 
—The Last Human Stranger. It whispered softly as she removed it from 
the shelf. Some dust showered down. 

At the window, just as she was about to make her way out, the 
library door creaked apart. 

Her knee was up and her book-stealing hand was poised against the 
window frame. When she faced the noise, she found the mayor’s wife 
in a brand-new bathrobe and slippers. On the breast pocket of the 
robe sat an embroidered swastika. Propaganda even reached the 
bathroom. 

They watched each other. 

Liesel looked at Ilsa Hermann’s breast and raised her arm. “Heil 
Hitler.” 

She was just about to leave when a realization struck her. 
The cookies. 
They’d been there for weeks. 

That meant that if the mayor himself used the library, he must have 
seen them. He must have asked why they were there. Or—and as 
soon as Liesel felt this thought, it filled her with a strange optimism— 
perhaps it wasn’t the mayor’s library at all; it was hers. Ilsa 
Hermann’s. 

She didn’t know why it was so important, but she enjoyed the fact 
that the roomful of books belonged to the woman. It was she who 
introduced her to the library in the first place and gave her the initial, 
even literal, window of opportunity. This way was better. It all 
seemed to fit. 

Just as she began to move again, she propped everything and 
asked, “This is your room, isn’t it?” 

The mayor’s wife tightened. “I used to read in here, with my son. 
But then ...” 

Liesel’s hand touched the air behind her. She saw a mother reading 
on the floor with a young boy pointing at the pictures and the words. 
Then she saw a war at the window. “I know.” 

An exclamation entered from outside. 
“What did you say?!” 

Liesel spoke in a harsh whisper, behind her. “Keep quiet, Saukerl, 
and watch the street.” To Ilsa Hermann, she handed the words slowly 
across. “So all these books ...” 

“They’re mostly mine. Some are my husband’s, some were my 
son’s, as you know.” 

There was embarrassment now on Liesel’s behalf. Her cheeks were 
set alight. “I always thought this was the mayor’s room.” 

“Why?” The woman seemed amused. 

Liesel noticed that there were also swastikas on the toes of her 
slippers. “He’s the mayor. I thought he’d read a lot.” 

The mayor’s wife placed her hands in her side pockets. “Lately, it’s 
you who gets the most use out of this room.” 

“Have you read this one?” Liesel held up The Last Human Stranger. 
Ilsa looked more closely at the title. “I have, yes.” 
“Any good?” 
“Not bad.” 

There was an itch to leave then, but also a peculiar obligation to 
stay. She moved to speak, but the available words were too many and 
too fast. There were several attempts to snatch at them, but it was the 
mayor’s wife who took the initiative. 

She saw Rudy’s face in the window, or more to the point, his 
candlelit hair. “I think you’d better go,” she said. “He’s waiting for 
you.” 

On the way home, they ate. 
“Are you sure there wasn’t anything else?” Rudy asked. “There 

must have been.” 

“We were lucky to get the cookies.” Liesel examined the gift in 
Rudy’s arms. “Now tell the truth. Did you eat any before I came back 
out?” 
Rudy was indignant. “Hey, you’re the thief here, not me.” 

“Don’t kid me, Saukerl, I could see some sugar at the side of your 
mouth.” 

Paranoid, Rudy took the plate in just the one hand and wiped with 
the other. “I didn’t eat any, I promise.” 

Half the cookies were gone before they hit the bridge, and they 
shared the rest with Tommy Muller on Himmel Street. 

When they’d finished eating, there was only one afterthought, and 
Rudy spoke it. 

“What the hell do we do with the plate?” 

THE CARDPLAYER 

Around the time Liesel and Rudy were eating the cookies, the resting 
men of the LSE were playing cards in a town not far from Essen. 
They’d just completed the long trip from Stuttgart and were gambling 
for cigarettes. Reinhold Zucker was not a happy man. 
“He’s cheating, I swear it,” he muttered. They were in a shed that 
served as their barracks and Hans Hubermann had just won his third 
consecutive hand. Zucker threw his cards down in disgust and 
combed his greasy hair with a threesome of dirty fingernails. 

e e © SOME FACTS ABOUT = « « 
REINHOLD ZUCKER 
He was twenty-four. When he won a round 
of cards, he gloated—he would hold the 
thin cylinders of tobacco to his nose and 
breathe them in. “The smell of victory,” 
he would say. Oh, and one more thing. 
He would die with his mouth open. 

Unlike the young man to his left, Hans Hubermann didn’t gloat when 
he won. He was even generous enough to give each colleague one of 
his cigarettes back and light it for him. All but Reinhold Zucker took 
up the invitation. He snatched at the offering and flung it back to the 
middle of the turned-over box. “I don’t need your charity, old man.” 
He stood up and left. 

“Whats wrong with him?” the sergeant inquired, but no one cared 
enough to answer. Reinhold Zucker was just a twenty-four-year-old 
boy who could not play cards to save his life. 
Had he not lost his cigarettes to Hans Hubermann, he wouldn’t 
have despised him. If he hadn’t despised him, he might not have 
taken his place a few weeks later on a fairly innocuous road. 

One seat, two men, a short argument, and me. 

It kills me sometimes, how people die. 

THE SNOWS OF STALINGRAD 

In the middle of January 1943, the corridor of Himmel Street was its 
dark, miserable self. Liesel shut the gate and made her way to Frau 
Holtzapfel’s door and knocked. She was surprised by the answerer. 

Her first thought was that the man must have been one of her sons, 
but he did not look like either of the brothers in the framed photos by 
the door. He seemed far too old, although it was difficult to tell. His 
face was dotted with whiskers and his eyes looked painful and loud. A 
bandaged hand fell out of his coat sleeve and cherries of blood were 
seeping through the wrapping. 
“Perhaps you should come back later.” 

Liesel tried to look past him. She was close to calling out to Frau 
Holtzapfel, but the man blocked her. 

“Child,” he said. “Come back later. ll get you. Where are you 
from?” 

More than three hours later, a knock arrived at 33 Himmel Street and 
the man stood before her. The cherries of blood had grown into 
plums. 

“She’s ready for you now.” 

Outside, in the fuzzy gray light, Liesel couldn’t help asking the man 
what had happened to his hand. He blew some air from his nostrils— 
a single syllable—before his reply. “Stalingrad.” 

“Sorry?” He had looked into the wind when he spoke. “I couldn’t 
hear you.” 

He answered again, only louder, and now, he answered the 
question fully. “Stalingrad happened to my hand. I was shot in the 
ribs and I had three of my fingers blown off. Does that answer your 
question?” He placed his uninjured hand in his pocket and shivered 
with contempt for the German wind. “You think it’s cold here?” 

Liesel touched the wall at her side. She couldn’t lie. “Yes, of 
course.” 

The man laughed. “This isn’t cold.” He pulled out a cigarette and 
placed it in his mouth. One-handed, he tried to light a match. In the 
dismal weather, it would have been difficult with both hands, but 
with just the one, it was impossible. He dropped the matchbook and 
swore. 
Liesel picked it up. 
She took his cigarette and put it in her mouth. She, too, could not 
light it. 
“You have to suck on it,” the man explained. “In this weather, it 
only lights when you suck. Verstehst?” 
She gave it another go, trying to remember how Papa did it. This 
time, her mouth filled with smoke. It climbed her teeth and scratched 
her throat, but she restrained herself from coughing. 
“Well done.” When he took the cigarette and breathed it in, he 
reached out his uninjured hand, his left. “Michael Holtzapfel.” 
“Liesel Meminger.” 
“You're coming to read to my mother?” 
Rosa arrived behind her at that point, and Liesel could feel the 
shock at her back. “Michael?” she asked. “Is that you?” 
Michael Holtzapfel nodded. “Guten Tag, Frau Hubermann. It’s been 
a long time.” 
“You look so ...” 
“Old?” 
Rosa was still in shock, but she composed herself. “Would you like 
to come in? I see you met my foster daughter ....” Her voice trailed 

off as she noticed the bloodied hand. 

“My brother’s dead,” said Michael Holtzapfel, and he could not 
have delivered the punch any better with his one usable fist. For Rosa 
staggered. Certainly, war meant dying, but it always shifted the 
ground beneath a person’s feet when it was someone who had once 
lived and breathed in close proximity. Rosa had watched both of the 
Holtzapfel boys grow up. 

The oldened young man somehow found a way to list what 
happened without losing his nerve. “I was in one of the buildings we 
used for a hospital when they brought him in. It was a week before I 
was coming home. I spent three days of that week sitting with him 
before he died ....” 

“Tm sorry.” The words didn’t seem to come from Rosa’s mouth. It 
was someone else standing behind Liesel Meminger that evening, but 
she did not dare to look. 

“Please.” Michael stopped her. “Don’t say anything else. Can I take 
the girl to read? I doubt my mother will hear it, but she said for her 
to come.” 

“Yes, take her.” 

They were halfway down the path when Michael Holtzapfel 
remembered himself and returned. “Rosa?” There was a moment of 
waiting while Mama rewidened the door. “I heard your son was 
there. In Russia. I ran into someone else from Molching and they told 
me. But I’m sure you knew that already.” 

Rosa tried to prevent his exit. She rushed out and held his sleeve. 
“No. He left here one day and never came back. We tried to find him, 
but then so much happened, there was ...” 

Michael Holtzapfel was determined to escape. The last thing he 
wanted to hear was yet another sob story. Pulling himself away, he 
said, “As far as I know, he’s alive.” He joined Liesel at the gate, but 
the girl did not walk next door. She watched Rosa’s face. It lifted and 
dropped in the same moment. 

“Mama?” 

Rosa raised her hand. “Go.” 
Liesel waited. 
“T said go.” 

When she caught up to him, the returned soldier tried to make 
conversation. He must have regretted his verbal mistake with Rosa, 
and he tried to bury it beneath some other words. Holding up the 
bandaged hand, he said, “I still can’t get it to stop bleeding.” Liesel 
was actually glad to enter the Holtzapfels’ kitchen. The sooner she 
started reading, the better. 
Frau Holtzapfel sat with wet streams of wire on her face. 
Her son was dead. 
But that was only the half of it. 
She would never really know how it occurred, but I can tell you 
without question that one of us here knows. I always seem to know 
what happened when there was snow and guns and the various 
confusions of human language. 

When I imagine Frau Holtzapfel’s kitchen from the book thief’s 
words, I don’t see the stove or the wooden spoons or the water pump, 
or anything of the sort. Not to begin with, anyway. What I see is the 
Russian winter and the snow falling from the ceiling, and the fate of 
Frau Holtzapfel’s second son. 

His name was Robert, and what happened to him was this. 

e e eA SMALL WAR STORY « « • 
His legs were blown off at the 
shins and he died with his 
brother watching in a cold, 
stench-filled hospital. 

It was Russia, January 5, 1943, and just another icy day. Out among 

the city and snow, there were dead Russians and Germans 
everywhere. Those who remained were firing into the blank pages in 
front of them. Three languages interwove. The Russian, the bullets, 
the German. 

As I made my way through the fallen souls, one of the men was 
saying, “My stomach is itchy.” He said it many times over. Despite his 
shock, he crawled up ahead, to a dark, disfigured figure who sat 
streaming on the ground. When the soldier with the wounded 
stomach arrived, he could see that it was Robert Holtzapfel. His hands 
were caked in blood and he was heaping snow onto the area just 
above his shins, where his legs had been chopped off by the last 
explosion. There were hot hands and a red scream. 

Steam rose from the ground. The sight and smell of rotting snow. 

“It’s me,” the soldier said to him. “It’s Pieter.” He dragged himself a 
few inches closer. 

“Pieter?” Robert asked, a vanishing voice. He must have felt me 
nearby. 

A second time. “Pieter?” 

For some reason, dying men always ask questions they know the 
answer to. Perhaps it’s so they can die being right. 

The voices suddenly all sounded the same. 

Robert Holtzapfel collapsed to his right, onto the cold and steamy 
ground. 

I’m sure he expected to meet me there and then. 
He didn’t. 

Unfortunately for the young German, I did not take him that 
afternoon. I stepped over him with the other poor souls in my arms 
and made my way back to the Russians. 

Back and forth, I traveled. 
Disassembled men. 

It was no ski trip, I can tell you. 

As Michael told his mother, it was three very long days later that I 
finally came for the soldier who left his feet behind in Stalingrad. I 
showed up very much invited at the temporary hospital and flinched 
at the smell. 

A man with a bandaged hand was telling the mute, shock-faced 
soldier that he would survive. “You'll soon be going home,” he 
assured him. 

Yes, home, I thought. For good. 

“Pl wait for you,” he continued. “I was going back at the end of the 
week, but Pll wait.” 

In the middle of his brother’s next sentence, I gathered up the soul 
of Robert Holtzapfel. 

Usually I need to exert myself, to look through the ceiling when I’m 
inside, but I was lucky in that particular building. A small section of 
the roof had been destroyed and I could see straight up. A meter 
away, Michael Holtzapfel was still talking. I tried to ignore him by 
watching the hole above me. The sky was white but deteriorating 
fast. As always, it was becoming an enormous drop sheet. Blood was 
bleeding through, and in patches, the clouds were dirty, like 
footprints in melting snow. 

Footprints? you ask. 
Well, I wonder whose those could be. 

In Frau Holtzapfel’s kitchen, Liesel read. The pages waded by 
unheard, and for me, when the Russian scenery fades in my eyes, the 
snow refuses to stop falling from the ceiling. The kettle is covered, as 
is the table. The humans, too, are wearing patches of snow on their 
heads and shoulders. 

The brother shivers. 
The woman weeps. 

And the girl goes on reading, for that’s why she’s there, and it feels 
good to be good for something in the aftermath of the snows of 
Stalingrad. 

THE AGELESS BROTHER 

Liesel Meminger was a few weeks short of fourteen. 
Her papa was still away. 

She’d completed three more reading sessions with a devastated 
woman. On many nights, she’d watched Rosa sit with the accordion 
and pray with her chin on top of the bellows. 

Now, she thought, it’s time. Usually it was stealing that cheered her 
up, but on this day, it was giving something back. 

She reached under her bed and removed the plate. As quickly as 
she could, she cleaned it in the kitchen and made her way out. It felt 
nice to be walking up through Molching. The air was sharp and flat, 
like the Watschen of a sadistic teacher or nun. Her shoes were the 
only sound on Munich Street. 

As she crossed the river, a rumor of sunshine stood behind the clouds. 

At 8 Grande Strasse, she walked up the steps, left the plate by the 
front door, and knocked, and by the time the door was opened, the 
girl was around the corner. Liesel did not look back, but she knew 
that if she did, she’d have found her brother at the bottom of the 
steps again, his knee completely healed. She could even hear his 
voice. 

“That’s better, Liesel.” 

It was with great sadness that she realized that her brother would be 
six forever, but when she held that thought, she also made an effort 
to smile. 

She remained at the Amper River, at the bridge, where Papa used 
to stand and lean. 

She smiled and smiled, and when it all came out, she walked home 
and her brother never climbed into her sleep again. In many ways, 
she would miss him, but she could never miss his deadly eyes on the 
floor of the train or the sound of a cough that killed. 

The book thief lay in bed that night, and the boy only came before 
she closed her eyes. He was one member of a cast, for Liesel was 
always visited in that room. Her papa stood and called her half a 
woman. Max was writing The Word Shaker in the corner. Rudy was 
naked by the door. Occasionally her mother stood on a bedside train 
platform. And far away, in the room that stretched like a bridge to a 
nameless town, her brother, Werner, played in the cemetery snow. 

From down the hall, like a metronome for the visions, Rosa snored, 
and Liesel lay awake surrounded, but also remembering a quote from 
her most recent book. 

e e e THE LAST HUMAN STRANGER, PAGE 38 « « « 
There were people everywhere on the city 
street, but the stranger could not have 
been more alone if it were empty. 

When morning came, the visions were gone and she could hear the 
quiet recital of words in the living room. Rosa was sitting with the 
accordion, praying. 
“Make them come back alive,” she repeated. “Please, Lord, please. 
All of them.” Even the wrinkles around her eyes were joining hands. 
The accordion must have ached her, but she remained. 
Rosa would never tell Hans about these moments, but Liesel 
believed that it must have been those prayers that helped Papa 

survive the LSE’s accident in Essen. If they didn’t help, they certainly 
can’t have hurt. 

THE ACCIDENT 

It was a surprisingly clear afternoon and the men were climbing into 
the truck. Hans Hubermann had just sat down in his appointed seat. 
Reinhold Zucker was standing above him. 

“Move it,” he said. 
“Bitte? Excuse me?” 

Zucker was hunched beneath the vehicle’s ceiling. “I said move it, 
Arschloch.” The greasy jungle of his fringe fell in clumps onto his 
forehead. “I’m swapping seats with you.” 

Hans was confused. The backseat was probably the most 
uncomfortable of the lot. It was the draftiest, the coldest. “Why?” 

“Does it matter?” Zucker was losing patience. “Maybe I want to get 
off first to use the shit house.” 

Hans was quickly aware that the rest of the unit was already 
watching this pitiful struggle between two supposed grown men. He 
didn’t want to lose, but he didn’t want to be petty, either. Also, they’d 
just finished a tiring shift and he didn’t have the energy to go on with 
it. Bent-backed, he made his way forward to the vacant seat in the 
middle of the truck. 

“Why did you give in to that Scheisskopf?” the man next to him 
asked. 

Hans lit a match and offered a share of the cigarette. “The draft 
back there goes straight through my ears.” 

The olive green truck was on its way toward the camp, maybe ten 
miles away. Brunnenweg was telling a joke about a French waitress 
when the left front wheel was punctured and the driver lost control. 
The vehicle rolled many times and the men swore as they tumbled 

with the air, the light, the trash, and the tobacco. Outside, the blue 
sky changed from ceiling to floor as they clambered for something to 
hold. 

When it stopped, they were all crowded onto the right-hand wall of 
the truck, their faces wedged against the filthy uniform next to them. 
Questions of health were passed around until one of the men, Eddie 
Alma, started shouting, “Get this bastard off me!” He said it three 
times, fast. He was staring into Reinhold Zucker’s blinkless eyes. 

e e ¢e THE DAMAGE, ESSEN « « « 
Six men burned by cigarettes. 
Two broken hands. 
Several broken fingers. 
A broken leg for Hans Hubermann. 
A broken neck for Reinhold 
Zucker, snapped almost in line 
with his earlobes. 

They dragged each other out until only the corpse was left in the 
truck. 

The driver, Helmut Brohmann, was sitting on the ground, 
scratching his head. “The tire,” he explained, “it just blew.” Some of 
the men sat with him and echoed that it wasn’t his fault. Others 
walked around smoking, asking each other if they thought their 
injuries were bad enough to be relieved of duty. Another small group 
gathered at the back of the truck and viewed the body. 

Over by a tree, a thin strip of intense pain was still opening in Hans 
Hubermann’s leg. “It should have been me,” he said. 

“What?” the sergeant called over from the truck. 
“He was sitting in my seat.” 

Helmut Brohmann regained his senses and climbed back into the 
driver’s compartment. Sideways, he tried to start the engine, but there 
was no kicking it over. Another truck was sent for, as was an 
ambulance. The ambulance didn’t come. 

“You know what that means, don’t you?” said Boris Schipper. They 
did. 

When they resumed the trip back to camp, each man tried not to look 
down at Reinhold Zucker’s openmouthed sneer. “I told you we should 
have turned him facedown,” someone mentioned. A few times, some 
of them simply forgot and rested their feet on the body. Once they 
arrived, they all tried to avoid the task of pulling him out. When the 
job was done, Hans Hubermann took a few abbreviated steps before 
the pain fractured in his leg and brought him down. 

An hour later, when the doctor examined him, he was told it was 
definitely broken. The sergeant was on hand and stood with half a 
grin. 
“Well, Hubermann. Looks like you’ve got away with it, doesn’t it?” 
He was shaking his round face, smoking, and he provided a list of 
what would happen next. “You’ll rest up. They’ll ask me what we 
should do with you. Ill tell them you did a great job.” He blew some 
more smoke. “And I think Ill tell them you’re not fit for the LSE 
anymore and you should be sent back to Munich to work in an office 
or do whatever cleaning up needs doing there. How does that sound?” 

Unable to resist a laugh within the grimace of pain, Hans replied, 
“Tt sounds good, Sergeant.” 
Boris Schipper finished his cigarette. “Damn right it sounds good. 
You're lucky I like you, Hubermann. You’re lucky you’re a good man, 
and generous with the cigarettes.” 

In the next room, they were making up the plaster. 

THE BITTER TASTE OF QUESTIONS 

Just over a week after Liesel’s birthday in mid-February, she and Rosa 
finally received a detailed letter from Hans Hubermann. She ran 
inside from the mailbox and showed it to Mama. Rosa made her read 
it aloud, and they could not contain their excitement when Liesel read 
about his broken leg. She was stunned to the extent that she mouthed 
the next sentence only to herself. 

“What is it?” Rosa pushed. “Saumensch?” 

Liesel looked up from the letter and was close to shouting. The 
sergeant had been true to his word. “He’s coming home, Mama. 
Papa’s coming home!” 

They embraced in the kitchen and the letter was crushed between 
their bodies. A broken leg was certainly something to celebrate. 

When Liesel took the news next door, Barbara Steiner was ecstatic. 
She rubbed the girl’s arms and called out to the rest of her family. In 
their kitchen, the household of Steiners seemed buoyed by the news 
that Hans Hubermann was returning home. Rudy smiled and laughed, 
and Liesel could see that he was at least trying. However, she could 
also sense the bitter taste of questions in his mouth. 

Why him? 
Why Hans Hubermann and not Alex Steiner? 
He had a point. 

ONE TOOLBOX, ONE BLEEDER, ONE BEAR 

Since his father’s recruitment to the army the previous October, 
Rudy’s anger had been growing nicely. The news of Hans 
Hubermann’s return was all he needed to take it a few steps further. 
He did not tell Liesel about it. There was no complaining that it 
wasn’t fair. His decision was to act. 

He carried a metal case up Himmel Street at the typical thieving 
time of darkening afternoon. 

¢ e « RUDY’S TOOLBOX « « « 
It was patchy red and the 
length of an oversized shoe box. 
It contained the following: 
Rusty pocketknife x 1 
Small flashlight x 1 
Hammer X 2 
(one medium, one small) 
Hand towel x 1 
Screwdriver x 3 
(varying in size) 
Ski mask x ı 
Clean socks x ı 
Teddy bear x ı 

Liesel saw him from the kitchen window—his purposeful steps and 
committed face, exactly like the day he’d gone to find his father. He 

gripped the handle with as much force as he could, and his 
movements were stiff with rage. 

The book thief dropped the towel she was holding and replaced it 
with a single thought. 
He’s going stealing. 
She ran out to meet him. 

There was not even the semblance of a hello. 

Rudy simply continued walking and spoke through the cold air in 
front of him. Close to Tommy Müller’s apartment block, he said, “You 
know something, Liesel, I was thinking. You’re not a thief at all,” and 
he didn’t give her a chance to reply. “That woman lets you in. She 
even leaves you cookies, for Christ’s sake. I don’t call that stealing. 
Stealing is what the army does. Taking your father, and mine.” He 
kicked a stone and it clanged against a gate. He walked faster. “All 
those rich Nazis up there, on Grande Strasse, Gelb Strasse, Heide 
Strasse.” 

Liesel could concentrate on nothing but keeping up. They’d already 
passed Frau Diller’s and were well onto Munich Street. “Rudy—” 

“How does it feel, anyway?” 
“How does what feel?” 
“When you take one of those books?” 

At that moment, she chose to keep still. If he wanted an answer, 
he’d have to come back, and he did. “Well?” But again, it was Rudy 
who answered, before Liesel could even open her mouth. “It feels 
good, doesn’t it? To steal something back.” 
Liesel forced her attention to the toolbox, trying to slow him down. 
“What have you got in there?” 
He bent over and opened it up. 

Everything appeared to make sense but the teddy bear. 

As they kept walking, Rudy explained the toolbox at length, and what 
he would do with each item. For example, the hammers were for 
smashing windows and the towel was to wrap them up, to quell the 
sound. 

“And the teddy bear?” 

It belonged to Anna-Marie Steiner and was no bigger than one of 
Liesel’s books. The fur was shaggy and worn. The eyes and ears had 
been sewn back on repeatedly, but it was friendly looking 
nonetheless. 

“That,” answered Rudy, “is the one masterstroke. That’s if a kid 
walks in while I’m inside. I'll give it to them to calm them down.” 

“And what do you plan to steal?” 

He shrugged. “Money, food, jewelry. Whatever I can get my hands 
on.” It sounded simple enough. 

It wasn’t until fifteen minutes later, when Liesel watched the sudden 
silence on his face, that she realized Rudy Steiner wasn’t stealing 
anything. The commitment had disappeared, and although he still 
watched the imagined glory of stealing, she could see that now he 
was not believing it. He was trying to believe it, and that’s never a 
good sign. His criminal greatness was unfurling before his eyes, and 
as the footsteps slowed and they watched the houses, Liesel’s relief 
was pure and sad inside her. 

It was Gelb Strasse. 
On the whole, the houses sat dark and huge. 

Rudy took off his shoes and held them with his left hand. He held 
the toolkit with his right. 

Between the clouds, there was a moon. Perhaps a mile of light. 

“What am I waiting for?” he asked, but Liesel didn’t reply. Again, 
Rudy opened his mouth, but without any words. He placed the 
toolbox on the ground and sat on it. 

His socks grew cold and wet. 

“Lucky there’s another pair in the toolbox,” Liesel suggested, and 
she could see him trying not to laugh, despite himself. 

Rudy moved across and faced the other way, and there was room for 
Liesel now as well. 

The book thief and her best friend sat back to back on a patchy red 
toolbox in the middle of the street. Each facing a different way, they 
remained for quite a while. When they stood up and went home, 
Rudy changed his socks and left the previous ones on the road. A gift, 
he decided, for Gelb Strasse. 

e e ¢ THE SPOKEN TRUTH = « « 
OF RUDY STEINER 
“I guess I’m better at leaving 
things behind than stealing them.” 

A few weeks later, the toolbox ended up being good for at least 
something. Rudy cleared it of screwdrivers and hammers and chose 
instead to store in it many of the Steiners’ valuables for the next air 
raid. The only item that remained was the teddy bear. 

On March 9, Rudy exited the house with it when the sirens made 
their presence felt again in Molching. 

While the Steiners rushed down Himmel Street, Michael Holtzapfel 
was knocking furiously at Rosa Hubermann’s door. When she and 
Liesel came out, he handed them his problem. “My mother,” he said, 
and the plums of blood were still on his bandage. “She won’t come 
out. She’s sitting at the kitchen table.” 

As the weeks had worn on, Frau Holtzapfel had not yet begun to 
recover. When Liesel came to read, the woman spent most of the time 
staring at the window. Her words were quiet, close to motionless. All 
brutality and reprimand were wrested from her face. It was usually 
Michael who said goodbye to Liesel or gave her the coffee and 

thanked her. Now this. 
Rosa moved into action. 
She waddled swiftly through the gate and stood in the open 
doorway. “Holtzapfel!” There was nothing but sirens and Rosa. 
“Holtzapfel, get out here, you miserable old swine!” Tact had never 
been Rosa Hubermann’s strong point. “If you don’t come out, we’re 
all going to die here on the street!” She turned and viewed the 
helpless figures on the footpath. A siren had just finished wailing. 
“What now?” 
Michael shrugged, disoriented, perplexed. Liesel dropped her bag of 
books and faced him. She shouted at the commencement of the next 
siren. “Can I go in?” But she didn’t wait for the answer. She ran the 
short distance of the path and shoved past Mama. 
Frau Holtzapfel was unmoved at the table. 
What do I say? Liesel thought. 
How do I get her to move? 
When the sirens took another breath, she heard Rosa calling out. 
“Just leave her, Liesel, we have to go! If she wants to die, that’s her 
business,” but then the sirens resumed. They reached down and 
tossed the voice away. 
Now it was only noise and girl and wiry woman. 
“Frau Holtzapfel, please!” 
Much like her conversation with Ilsa Hermann on the day of the 
cookies, a multitude of words and sentences were at her fingertips. 
The difference was that today there were bombs. Today it was slightly 
more urgent. 

e e e THE OPTIONS « « « 
e “Frau Holtzapfel, we have to go.” 
e “Frau Holtzapfel, we’ll die if we stay here.” 
e “You still have one son left.” 

- “Everyone’s waiting for you.” 
e “The bombs will blow your head off.” 
e “If you don’t come, I’ll stop coming to read to you, and that 
means you’ve lost your only friend.” 

She went with the last sentence, calling the words directly through 
the sirens. Her hands were planted on the table. 
The woman looked up and made her decision. She didn’t move. 

Liesel left. She withdrew herself from the table and rushed from the 
house. 

Rosa held open the gate and they started running to number forty- 
five. Michael Holtzapfel remained stranded on Himmel Street. 
“Come on!” Rosa implored him, but the returned soldier hesitated. 
He was just about to make his way back inside when something 
turned him around. His mutilated hand was the only thing attached 
to the gate, and shamefully, he dragged it free and followed. 
They all looked back several times, but there was still no Frau 
Holtzapfel. 
The road seemed so wide, and when the final siren evaporated into 
the air, the last three people on Himmel Street made their way into 
the Fiedlers’ basement. 
“What took you so long?” Rudy asked. He was holding the toolbox. 

Liesel placed her bag of books on the ground and sat on them. “We 
were trying to get Frau Holtzapfel.” 

Rudy looked around. “Where is she?” 
“At home. In the kitchen.” 

In the far corner of the shelter, Michael was cramped and shivery. “I 
should have stayed,” he said, “I should have stayed, I should have 

stayed ....” His voice was close to noiseless, but his eyes were louder 
than ever. They beat furiously in their sockets as he squeezed his 
injured hand and the blood rose through the bandage. 

It was Rosa who stopped him. 
“Please, Michael, it’s not your fault.” 

But the young man with only a few remaining fingers on his right 
hand was inconsolable. He crouched in Rosa’s eyes. 

“Tell me something,” he said, “because I don’t understand ....” He 
fell back and sat against the wall. “Tell me, Rosa, how she can sit 
there ready to die while I still want to live.” The blood thickened. 
“Why do I want to live? I shouldn’t want to, but I do.” 

The young man wept uncontrollably with Rosa’s hand on his 
shoulder for many minutes. The rest of the people watched. He could 
not make himself stop even when the basement door opened and shut 
and Frau Holtzapfel entered the shelter. 

Her son looked up. 
Rosa stepped away. 

When they came together, Michael apologized. “Mama, I’m sorry, I 
should have stayed with you.” 

Frau Holtzapfel didn’t hear. She only sat with her son and lifted his 
bandaged hand. “Youre bleeding again,” she said, and with everyone 
else, they sat and waited. 

Liesel reached into her bag and rummaged through the books. 

e e e THE BOMBING OF MUNICH, •¢ •¢ ù 
MARCH 9 AND 10 
The night was long with bombs 
and reading. Her mouth was 
dry, but the book thief worked 
through fifty-four pages. 

The majority of children slept and didn’t hear the sirens of renewed 
safety. Their parents woke them or carried them up the basement 
steps, into the world of darkness. 

Far away, fires were burning and I had picked up just over two 
hundred murdered souls. 

I was on my way to Molching for one more. 

Himmel Street was clear. 

The sirens had been held off for many hours, just in case there was 
another threat and to allow the smoke to make its way into the 
atmosphere. 

It was Bettina Steiner who noticed the small fire and the sliver of 
smoke farther down, close to the Amper River. It trailed into the sky 
and the girl held up her finger. “Look.” 

The girl might have seen it first, but it was Rudy who reacted. In his 
haste, he did not relinquish his grip on the toolbox as he sprinted to 
the bottom of Himmel Street, took a few side roads, and entered the 
trees. Liesel was next (having surrendered her books to a heavily 
protesting Rosa), and then a smattering of people from several 
shelters along the way. 

“Rudy, wait!” 
Rudy did not wait. 

Liesel could only see the toolbox in certain gaps in the trees as he 
made his way through to the dying glow and the misty plane. It sat 
smoking in the clearing by the river. The pilot had tried to land there. 

Within twenty meters, Rudy stopped. 

Just as I arrived myself, I noticed him standing there, recovering 
his breath. 

The limbs of trees were scattered in the dark. 

There were twigs and needles littered around the plane like fire 
fuel. To their left, three gashes were burned into the earth. The 
runaway ticktock of cooling metal sped up the minutes and seconds 
till they were standing there for what felt like hours. The growing 
crowd was assembling behind them, their breath and sentences 
sticking to Liesel’s back. 

“Well,” said Rudy, “should we take a look?” 
He stepped through the remainder of trees to where the body of the 
plane was fixed to the ground. Its nose was in the running water and 
the wings were left crookedly behind. 
Rudy circled slowly, from the tail and around to the right. 
“There’s glass,” he said. “The windshield is everywhere.” 
Then he saw the body. 

Rudy Steiner had never seen a face so pale. 
“Don’t come, Liesel.” But Liesel came. 

She could see the barely conscious face of the enemy pilot as the 
tall trees watched and the river ran. The plane let out a few more 
coughs and the head inside tilted from left to right. He said something 
they obviously could not understand. 

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” Rudy whispered. “He’s alive.” 

The toolbox bumped the side of the plane and brought with it the 
sound of more human voices and feet. 

The glow of fire was gone and the morning was still and black. 
Only the smoke was in its way, but it, too, would soon be exhausted. 

The wall of trees kept the color of a burning Munich at bay. By 
now, the boy’s eyes had adjusted not only to the darkness, but to the 
face of the pilot. The eyes were like coffee stains, and gashes were 
ruled across his cheeks and chin. A ruffled uniform sat, unruly, across 
his chest. 

Despite Rudy’s advice, Liesel came even closer, and I can promise you 
that we recognized each other at that exact moment. 

I know you, I thought. 

There was a train and a coughing boy. There was snow and a 
distraught girl. 

You’ve grown, I thought, but I recognize you. 

She did not back away or try to fight me, but I know that 
something told the girl I was there. Could she smell my breath? Could 
she hear my cursed circular heartbeat, revolving like the crime it is in 
my deathly chest? I don’t know, but she knew me and she looked me 
in my face and she did not look away. 

As the sky began to charcoal toward light, we both moved on. We 
both observed the boy as he reached into his toolbox again and 
searched through some picture frames to pull out a small, stuffed 
yellow toy. 

Carefully, he climbed to the dying man. 

He placed the smiling teddy bear cautiously onto the pilot’s 
shoulder. The tip of its ear touched his throat. 

The dying man breathed it in. He spoke. In English, he said, “Thank 
you.” His straight-line cuts opened as he spoke, and a small drop of 
blood rolled crookedly down his throat. 

“What?” Rudy asked him. “Was hast du gesagt? What did you say?” 

Unfortunately, I beat him to the answer. The time was there and I 
was reaching into the cockpit. I slowly extracted the pilot’s soul from 
his ruffled uniform and rescued him from the broken plane. The 
crowd played with the silence as I made my way through. I jostled 
free. 
Above me, the sky eclipsed—just a last moment of darkness—and I 
swear I could see a black signature in the shape of a swastika. It 
loitered untidily above. 
“Heil Hitler,” I said, but I was well into the trees by then. Behind 
me, a teddy bear rested on the shoulder of a corpse. A lemon candle 

stood below the branches. The pilot’s soul was in my arms. 

It’s probably fair to say that in all the years of Hitler’s reign, no 
person was able to serve the Fuhrer as loyally as me. A human doesn’t 
have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is 
a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the 
right time. The consequence of this is that I’m always finding humans 
at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I 
wonder how the same thing can be both. Still, they have one thing I 
envy. Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die. 

HOMECOMING 

It was a time of bleeders and broken planes and teddy bears, but the 
first quarter of 1943 was to finish on a positive note for the book 
thief. 

At the beginning of April, Hans Hubermann’s plaster was trimmed 
to the knee and he boarded a train for Munich. He would be given a 
week of rest and recreation at home before joining the ranks of army 
pen pushers in the city. He would help with the paperwork on the 
cleanup of Munich’s factories, houses, churches, and hospitals. Time 
would tell if he would be sent out to do the repair work. That all 
depended on his leg and the state of the city. 

It was dark when he arrived home. It was a day later than expected, 
as the train was delayed due to an air-raid scare. He stood at the door 
of 33 Himmel Street and made a fist. 

Four years earlier, Liesel Meminger was coaxed through that 
doorway when she showed up for the first time. Max Vandenburg had 
stood there with a key biting into his hand. Now it was Hans 
Hubermann’s turn. He knocked four times and the book thief 
answered. 

“Papa, Papa.” 
She must have said it a hundred times as she hugged him in the 
kitchen and wouldn’t let go. 

Later, after they ate, they sat at the kitchen table long into the night 
and Hans told his wife and Liesel Meminger everything. He explained 
the LSE and the smoke-filled streets and the poor, lost, wandering 
souls. And Reinhold Zucker. Poor, stupid Reinhold Zucker. It took 
hours. 

At 1 a.m., Liesel went to bed and Papa came in to sit with her, like 
he used to. She woke up several times to check that he was there, and 
he did not fail her. 

The night was calm. 
Her bed was warm and soft with contentment. 

Yes, it was a great night to be Liesel Meminger, and the calm, the 
warm, and the soft would remain for approximately three more 
months. 

But her story lasts for six. 

PART TEN 

the book thief 

featuring: 
the end of a world—the ninety-eighth day— 
a war maker—way of the words—a catatonic girl— 
confessions—ilsa hermann’s little black book— 

some rib-cage planes—and a mountain range of rubble 

THE END OF THE WORLD (Part I) 

Again, I offer you a glimpse of the end. Perhaps it’s to soften the blow 
for later, or to better prepare myself for the telling. Either way, I must 
inform you that it was raining on Himmel Street when the world 
ended for Liesel Meminger. 

The sky was dripping. 

Like a tap that a child has tried its hardest to turn off but hasn’t 
quite managed. The first drops were cool. I felt them on my hands as I 
stood outside Frau Diller’s. 

Above me, I could hear them. 

Through the overcast sky, I looked up and saw the tin-can planes. I 
watched their stomachs open and the bombs drop casually out. They 
were off target, of course. They were often off target. 

s e e A SMALL, SAD HOPE « « « 
No one wanted to 
bomb Himmel Street. 
No one would bomb a 
place named after 
heaven, would they? 
Would they? 

The bombs came down, and soon, the clouds would bake and the cold 
raindrops would turn to ash. Hot snowflakes would shower to the 
ground. 

In short, Himmel Street was flattened. 

Houses were splashed from one side of the street to the other. A 
framed photo of a very serious-looking Fuhrer was bashed and beaten 
on the shattered floor. Yet he smiled, in that serious way of his. He 
knew something we all didn’t know. But I knew something he didn’t 
know. All while people slept. 
Rudy Steiner slept. Mama and Papa slept. Frau Holtzapfel, Frau 
Diller. Tommy Miller. All sleeping. All dying. 

Only one person survived. 

She survived because she was sitting in a basement reading through 
the story of her own life, checking for mistakes. Previously, the room 
had been declared too shallow, but on that night, October 7, it was 
enough. The shells of wreckage cantered down, and hours later, when 
the strange, unkempt silence settled itself in Molching, the local LSE 
could hear something. An echo. Down there, somewhere, a girl was 
hammering a paint can with a pencil. 

They all stopped, with bent ears and bodies, and when they heard 
it again, they started digging. 

e e e PASSED ITEMS, HAND TO HAND « « « 
Blocks of cement and roof tiles. 
A piece of wall with a dripping 
sun painted on it. An unhappy-looking 
accordion, peering 
through its eaten case. 

They threw all of it upward. 

When another piece of broken wall was removed, one of them saw 
the book thief’s hair. 

The man had such a nice laugh. He was delivering a newborn child. 
“T can’t believe it—she’s alive!” 

There was so much joy among the cluttering, calling men, but I 
could not fully share their enthusiasm. 

Earlier, ’d held her papa in one arm and her mama in the other. Each 
soul was so soft. 

Farther away, their bodies were laid out, like the rest. Papa’s lovely 
silver eyes were already starting to rust, and Mama’s cardboard lips 
were fixed half open, most likely the shape of an incomplete snore. To 
blaspheme like the Germans—Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. 

The rescuing hands pulled Liesel out and brushed the crumbs of 
rubble from her clothes. “Young girl,” they said, “the sirens were too 
late. What were you doing in the basement? How did you know?” 
What they didn’t notice was that the girl was still holding the book. 
She screamed her reply. A stunning scream of the living. 
“Papa!” 
A second time. Her face creased as she reached a higher, more 
panic-stricken pitch. “Papa, Papa!” 
They passed her up as she shouted, wailed, and cried. If she was 
injured, she did not yet know it, for she struggled free and searched 
and called and wailed some more. 

She was still clutching the book. 

She was holding desperately on to the words who had saved her 
life. 

THE NINETY-EIGHTH DAY 

For the first ninety-seven days after Hans Hubermann’s return in April 
1943, everything was fine. On many occasions he was pensive about 
the thought of his son fighting in Stalingrad, but he hoped that some 
of his luck was in the boy’s blood. 

On his third night at home, he played the accordion in the kitchen. 
A promise was a promise. There was music, soup, and jokes, and the 
laughter of a fourteen-year-old girl. 

“Saumensch,” Mama warned her, “stop laughing so loud. His jokes 
aren’t that funny. And they’re filthy, too ....” 

After a week, Hans resumed his service, traveling into the city to 
one of the army offices. He said that there was a good supply of 
cigarettes and food there, and sometimes he was able to bring home 
some cookies or extra jam. It was like the good old days. A minor air 
raid in May. A “heil Hitler” here or there and everything was fine. 

Until the ninety-eighth day. 

e ¢ « A SMALL STATEMENT « « « 
BY AN OLD WOMAN 
On Munich Street, she said, “Jesus, 
Mary, and Joseph, I wish they 
wouldn’t bring them through. These 
wretched Jews, they’re rotten luck. 
They’re a bad sign. Every time I see 
them, I know we’ll be ruined.” 

It was the same old lady who announced the Jews the first time Liesel 
saw them. On ground level, her face was a prune. Her eyes were the 

dark blue of a vein. And her prediction was accurate. 

In the heart of summer, Molching was delivered a sign of things to 
come. It moved into sight like it always did. First the bobbing head of 
a soldier and the gun poking at the air above him. Then the ragged 
chain of clinking Jews. 

The only difference this time was that they were brought from the 
opposite direction. They were taken through to the neighboring town 
of Nebling to scrub the streets and do the cleanup work that the army 
refused to do. Late in the day, they were marched back to camp, slow 
and tired, defeated. 

Again, Liesel searched for Max Vandenburg, thinking that he could 
easily have ended up in Dachau without being marched through 
Molching. He was not there. Not on this occasion. 

Just give it time, though, for on a warm afternoon in August, Max 
would most certainly be marched through town with the rest of them. 
Unlike the others, however, he would not watch the road. He would 
not look randomly into the Führer’s German grandstand. 

e e eA FACT REGARDING « « « 
MAX VANDENBURG 
He would search the faces on Munich 
Street for a book-thieving girl. 

On this occasion, in July, on what Liesel later calculated as the 
ninety-eighth day of her papa’s return, she stood and studied the 
moving pile of mournful Jews—looking for Max. If nothing else, it 
alleviated the pain of simply watching. 

That’s a horrible thought, she would write in her Himmel Street 
basement, but she knew it to be true. The pain of watching them. 
What about their pain? The pain of stumbling shoes and torment and 
the closing gates of the camp? 

They came through twice in ten days, and soon after, the anonymous, 
prune-faced woman on Munich Street was proven absolutely correct. 
Suffering had most definitely come, and if they could blame the Jews 
as a warning or prologue, they should have blamed the Fuhrer and his 
quest for Russia as the actual cause—for when Himmel Street woke 
later in July, a returned soldier was discovered to be dead. He was 
hanging from one of the rafters in a laundry up near Frau Diller’s. 
Another human pendulum. Another clock, stopped. 

The careless owner had left the door open. 

ee « JULY 24, 6:03 A.M. « « « 
The laundry was warm, 
the rafters were firm, 
and Michael Holtzapfel 
jumped from the chair 
as if it were a cliff. 

So many people chased after me in that time, calling my name, asking 
me to take them with me. Then there was the small percentage who 
called me casually over and whispered with their tightened voices. 
“Have me,” they said, and there was no stopping them. They were 
frightened, no question, but they were not afraid of me. It was a fear 

of messing up and having to face themselves again, and facing the 
world, and the likes of you. 

There was nothing I could do. 

They had too many ways, they were too resourceful—and when 
they did it too well, whatever their chosen method, I was in no 
position to refuse. 

Michael Holtzapfel knew what he was doing. 

He killed himself for wanting to live. 

Of course, I did not see Liesel Meminger at all that day. As is usually 
the case, I advised myself that I was far too busy to remain on 
Himmel Street to listen to the screams. It’s bad enough when people 
catch me red-handed, so I made the usual decision to make my exit, 
into the breakfast-colored sun. 

I did not hear the detonation of an old man’s voice when he found 
the hanging body, nor the sound of running feet and jaw-dropped 
gasps when other people arrived. I did not hear a skinny man with a 
mustache mutter, “Crying shame, a damn shame ...” 

I did not see Frau Holtzapfel laid out flat on Himmel Street, her 
arms out wide, her screaming face in total despair. No, I didn’t 
discover any of that until I came back a few months later and read 
something called The Book Thief. It was explained to me that in the 
end, Michael Holtzapfel was worn down not by his damaged hand or 
any other injury, but by the guilt of living. 
In the lead-up to his death, the girl had realized that he wasn’t 
sleeping, that each night was like poison. I often imagine him lying 
awake, sweating in sheets of snow, or seeing visions of his brother’s 
severed legs. Liesel wrote that sometimes she almost told him about 
her own brother, like she did with Max, but there seemed a big 
difference between a long-distance cough and two obliterated legs. 
How do you console a man who has seen such things? Could you tell 
him the Führer was proud of him, that the Führer loved him for what 
he did in Stalingrad? How could you even dare? You can only let him 
do the talking. The dilemma, of course, is that such people save their 
most important words for after, when the surrounding humans are 
unlucky enough to find them. A note, a sentence, even a question, or 
a letter, like on Himmel Street in July 1943. 

e e e MICHAEL HOLTZAPFEL— « « « 
THE LAST GOODBYE 

Dear Mama, 
Can you ever forgive me? 
I just couldn’t stand it any longer. 
I’m meeting Robert. I don’t care 
what the damn Catholics say about it. 
There must be a place in heaven for 
those who have been where I have been. 
You might think I don’t love you 
because of what I’ve done, but I do. 
Your Michael 

It was Hans Hubermann who was asked to give Frau Holtzapfel the 
news. He stood on her threshold and she must have seen it on his 
face. Two sons in six months. 

The morning sky stood blazing behind him as the wiry woman 
made her way past. She ran sobbing to the gathering farther up on 
Himmel Street. She said the name Michael at least two dozen times, 
but Michael had already answered. According to the book thief, Frau 
Holtzapfel hugged the body for nearly an hour. She then returned to 
the blinding sun of Himmel Street and sat herself down. She could no 
longer walk. 

From a distance, people observed. Such a thing was easier from far 
away. 

Hans Hubermann sat with her. 
He placed his hand on hers, as she fell back to the hard ground. 
He allowed her screams to fill the street. 

Much later, Hans walked with her, with painstaking care, through her 
front gate, and into the house. And no matter how many times I try to 
see it differently, I can’t pull it off .... 

When I imagine that scene of the distraught woman and the tall 
silver-eyed man, it is still snowing in the kitchen of 31 Himmel Street. 

THE WAR MAKER 

There was the smell of a freshly cut coffin. Black dresses. Enormous 
suitcases under the eyes. Liesel stood like the rest, on the grass. She 
read to Frau Holtzapfel that same afternoon. The Dream Carrier, her 
neighbor’s favorite. 

It was a busy day all around, really. 

s e e JULY 27, 1943 « « » 
Michael Holtzapfel was buried and the book 
thief read to the bereaved. The Allies bombed 
Hamburg—and on that subject, it’s lucky Pm 
somewhat miraculous. No one else could carry close to 
forty-five thousand people in such a short amount 
of time. Not in a million human years. 

The Germans were starting to pay in earnest by then. The Führer’s 
pimply little knees were starting to shake. 

Still, Pll give him something, that Führer. 
He certainly had an iron will. 

There was no slackening off in terms of war-making, nor was there 
any scaling back on the extermination and punishment of a Jewish 
plague. While most of the camps were spread throughout Europe, 
there were some still in existence in Germany itself. 
In those camps, many people were still made to work, and walk. 

Max Vandenburg was one such Jew. 

WAY OF THE WORDS 

It happened in a small town of Hitler’s heartland. 

The flow of more suffering was pumped nicely out, and a small 
piece of it had now arrived. 

Jews were being marched through the outskirts of Munich, and one 
teenage girl somehow did the unthinkable and made her way through 
to walk with them. When the soldiers pulled her away and threw her 
to the ground, she stood up again. She continued. 

The morning was warm. 
Another beautiful day for a parade. 

The soldiers and Jews made their way through several towns and 
were arriving now in Molching. It was possible that more work 
needed to be done in the camp, or several prisoners had died. 
Whatever the reason, a new batch of fresh, tired Jews was being 
taken on foot to Dachau. 

As she always did, Liesel ran to Munich Street with the usual band 
of onlookers. 

“Heil Hitler!” 

She could hear the first soldier from far up the road and made her 
way toward him through the crowd, to meet the procession. The 
voice amazed her. It made the endless sky into a ceiling just above his 
head, and the words bounced back, landing somewhere on the floor 
of limping Jewish feet. 

Their eyes. 

They watched the moving street, one by one, and when Liesel 
found a good vantage point, she stopped and studied them. She raced 
through the files of face after face, trying to match them to the Jew 
who wrote The Standover Man and The Word Shaker. 
Feathery hair, she thought. 
No, hair like twigs. That’s what it looks like when it hasn’t been 
washed. Look out for hair like twigs and swampy eyes and a kindling 
beard. 

God, there were so many of them. 
So many sets of dying eyes and scuffing feet. 

Liesel searched them and it was not so much a recognition of facial 
features that gave Max Vandenburg away. It was how the face was 
acting—also studying the crowd. Fixed in concentration. Liesel felt 
herself pausing as she found the only face looking directly into the 
German spectators. It examined them with such purpose that people 
on either side of the book thief noticed and pointed him out. 

“What’s he looking at?” said a male voice at her side. 

The book thief stepped onto the road. 

Never had movement been such a burden. Never had a heart been 
so definite and big in her adolescent chest. 

She stepped forward and said, very quietly, “He’s looking for me.” 

Her voice trailed off and fell away, inside. She had to refind it— 
reaching far down, to learn to speak again and call out his name. 

Max. 

“Tm here, Max!” 

Louder. 
“Max, I’m here!” 

He heard her. 

e ee MAX VANDENBURG, AUGUST 1943 « « « 
There were twigs of hair, just like 
Liesel thought, and the swampy eyes 
stepped across, shoulder to shoulder 
over the other Jews. When they reached 
her, they pleaded. His beard 
stroked down his face and his mouth 
shivered as he said the word, 
the name, the girl. 
Liesel. 

Liesel shrugged away entirely from the crowd and entered the tide of 
Jews, weaving through them till she grabbed hold of his arm with her 
left hand. 

His face fell on her. 

It reached down as she tripped, and the Jew, the nasty Jew, helped 
her up. It took all of his strength. 
“Pm here, Max,” she said again. “I’m here.” 
“T can’t believe ...” The words dripped from Max Vandenburg’s 
mouth. “Look how much you’ve grown.” There was an intense 
sadness in his eyes. They swelled. “Liesel ... they got me a few 
months ago.” The voice was crippled but it dragged itself toward her. 
“Halfway to Stuttgart.” 

From the inside, the stream of Jews was a murky disaster of arms and 

legs. Ragged uniforms. No soldier had seen her yet, and Max gave her 
a warning. “You have to let go of me, Liesel.” He even tried to push 
her away, but the girl was too strong. Max’s starving arms could not 
sway her, and she walked on, between the filth, the hunger and 
confusion. 

After a long line of steps, the first soldier noticed. 

“Hey!” he called in. He pointed with his whip. “Hey, girl, what are 
you doing? Get out of there.” 

When she ignored him completely, the soldier used his arm to 
separate the stickiness of people. He shoved them aside and made his 
way through. He loomed above her as Liesel struggled on and noticed 
the strangled expression on Max Vandenburg’s face. She had seen him 
afraid, but never like this. 

The soldier took her. 
His hands manhandled her clothes. 

She could feel the bones in his fingers and the ball of each knuckle. 
They tore at her skin. “I said get out!” he ordered her, and now he 
dragged the girl to the side and flung her into the wall of onlooking 
Germans. It was getting warmer. The sun burned her face. The girl 
had landed sprawling with pain, but now she stood again. She 
recovered and waited. She reentered. 

This time, Liesel made her way through from the back. 

Ahead, she could just see the distinct twigs of hair and walked 
again toward them. 
This time, she did not reach out—she stopped. Somewhere inside 
her were the souls of words. They climbed out and stood beside her. 
“Max,” she said. He turned and briefly closed his eyes as the girl 
continued. “ ‘There was once a strange, small man,’ ” she said. Her 
arms were loose but her hands were fists at her side. “But there was a 
word shaker, too.” 

One of the Jews on his way to Dachau had stopped walking now. 

He stood absolutely still as the others swerved morosely around 
him, leaving him completely alone. His eyes staggered, and it was so 
simple. The words were given across from the girl to the Jew. They 
climbed on to him. 

The next time she spoke, the questions stumbled from her mouth. Hot 
tears fought for room in her eyes as she would not let them out. 
Better to stand resolute and proud. Let the words do all of it. “ ‘Is it 
really you? the young man asked,’ ” she said. “ ‘Is it from your cheek 
that I took the seed?’ ” 

Max Vandenburg remained standing. 
He did not drop to his knees. 
People and Jews and clouds all stopped. They watched. 

As he stood, Max looked first at the girl and then stared directly 
into the sky who was wide and blue and magnificent. There were 
heavy beams—planks of sun—falling randomly, wonderfully to the 
road. Clouds arched their backs to look behind as they started again 
to move on. “It’s such a beautiful day,” he said, and his voice was in 
many pieces. A great day to die. A great day to die, like this. 

Liesel walked at him. She was courageous enough to reach out and 
hold his bearded face. “Is it really you, Max?” 

Such a brilliant German day and its attentive crowd. 

He let his mouth kiss her palm. “Yes, Liesel, it’s me,” and he held 
the girl’s hand in his face and cried onto her fingers. He cried as the 
soldiers came and a small collection of insolent Jews stood and 
watched. 

Standing, he was whipped. 
“Max,” the girl wept. 
Then silently, as she was dragged away: 
Max. 

Jewish fist fighter. 
Inside, she said all of it. 

Maxi Taxi. That’s what that friend called you in Stuttgart when you 
fought on the street, remember? Remember, Max? You told me. I 
remember everything .... 

That was you—the boy with the hard fists, and you said you would 
land a punch on death’s face when he came for you. 

Remember the snowman, Max? 
Remember? 
In the basement? 
Remember the white cloud with the gray heart? 

The Fuhrer still comes down looking for you sometimes. He misses 
you. We all miss you. 

The whip. The whip. 

The whip continued from the soldier’s hand. It landed on Max’s face. 
It clipped his chin and carved his throat. 

Max hit the ground and the soldier now turned to the girl. His 
mouth opened. He had immaculate teeth. 

A sudden flash came before her eyes. She recalled the day she’d 
wanted Ilsa Hermann or at least the reliable Rosa to slap her, but 
neither of them would do it. On this occasion, she was not let down. 

The whip sliced her collarbone and reached across her shoulder 
blade. 

“Liesel!” 
She knew that person. 

As the soldier swung his arm, she caught sight of a distressed Rudy 
Steiner in the gaps of the crowd. He was calling out. She could see his 
tortured face and yellow hair. “Liesel, get out of there!” 

The book thief did not get out. 

She closed her eyes and caught the next burning streak, and 
another, till her body hit the warm flooring of the road. It heated her 
cheek. 

More words arrived, this time from the soldier. 
“Steh’auf.” 

The economical sentence was directed not to the girl but the Jew. It 
was elaborated on. “Get up, you dirty asshole, you Jewish whore-dog, 
get up, get up ....” 

Max hoisted himself upright. 
Just another push-up, Max. 
Just another push-up on the cold basement floor. 

His feet moved. 
They dragged and he traveled on. 

His legs staggered and his hands wiped at the marks of the whip, to 
soothe the stinging. When he tried to look again for Liesel, the 
soldier’s hands were placed upon his bloodied shoulders and pushed. 

The boy arrived. His lanky legs crouched and he called over, to his 
left. 

“Tommy, get out here and help me. We have to get her up. Tommy, 
hurry!” He lifted the book thief by her armpits. “Liesel, come on, you 
have to get off the road.” 

When she was able to stand, she looked at the shocked, frozen- 
faced Germans, fresh out of their packets. At their feet, she allowed 
herself to collapse, but only momentarily. A graze struck a match on 
the side of her face, where she’d met the ground. Her pulse flipped it 
over, frying it on both sides. 

Far down the road, she could see the blurry legs and heels of the 
last walking Jew. 

Her face was burning and there was a dogged ache in her arms and 
legs—a numbness that was simultaneously painful and exhausting. 

She stood, one last time. 

Waywardly, she began to walk and then run down Munich Street, 
to haul in the last steps of Max Vandenburg. 

“Liesel, what are you doing?!” 

She escaped the grip of Rudy’s words and ignored the watching 
people at her side. Most of them were mute. Statues with beating 
hearts. Perhaps bystanders in the latter stages of a marathon. Liesel 
cried out again and was not heard. Hair was in her eyes. “Please, 
Max!” 

After perhaps thirty meters, just as a soldier turned around, the girl 
was felled. Hands were clamped upon her from behind and the boy 
next door brought her down. He forced her knees to the road and 
suffered the penalty. He collected her punches as if they were 
presents. Her bony hands and elbows were accepted with nothing but 
a few short moans. He accumulated the loud, clumsy specks of saliva 
and tears as if they were lovely to his face, and more important, he 
was able to hold her down. 

On Munich Street, a boy and girl were entwined. 
They were twisted and comfortless on the road. 

Together, they watched the humans disappear. They watched them 
dissolve, like moving tablets in the humid air. 

CONFESSIONS 

When the Jews were gone, Rudy and Liesel untangled and the book 
thief did not speak. There were no answers to Rudy’s questions. 

Liesel did not go home, either. She walked forlornly to the train 
station and waited for her papa for hours. Rudy stood with her for the 
first twenty minutes, but since it was a good half day till Hans was 
due home, he fetched Rosa. On the way back, he told her what had 
happened, and when Rosa arrived, she asked nothing of the girl. She 
had already assembled the puzzle and merely stood beside her and 
eventually convinced her to sit down. They waited together. 

When Papa found out, he dropped his bag, he kicked the Bahnhof 
air. 

None of them ate that night. Papa’s fingers desecrated the 
accordion, murdering song after song, no matter how hard he tried. 
Everything no longer worked. 

For three days, the book thief stayed in bed. 

Every morning and afternoon, Rudy Steiner knocked on the door 
and asked if she was still sick. The girl was not sick. 

On the fourth day, Liesel walked to her neighbor’s front door and 
asked if he might go back to the trees with her, where they’d 
distributed the bread the previous year. 

“T should have told you earlier,” she said. 

As promised, they walked far down the road toward Dachau. They 

stood in the trees. There were long shapes of light and shade. 
Pinecones were scattered like cookies. 

Thank you, Rudy. 
For everything. For helping me off the road, for stopping me ... 
She said none of it. 

Her hand leaned on a flaking branch at her side. “Rudy, if I tell you 
something, will you promise not to say a word to anyone?” 

“Of course.” He could sense the seriousness in the girl’s face, and 
the heaviness in her voice. He leaned on the tree next to hers. “What 
is it?” 
“Promise.” 
“T did already.” 

“Do it again. You can’t tell your mother, your brother, or Tommy 
Miller. Nobody.” 

“I promise.” 
Leaning. 
Looking at the ground. 

She attempted several times to find the right place to start, reading 
sentences at her feet, joining words to the pinecones and the scraps of 
broken branches. 

“Remember when I was injured playing soccer,” she said, “out on 
the street?” 

It took approximately three-quarters of an hour to explain two 
wars, an accordion, a Jewish fist fighter, and a basement. Not 
forgetting what had happened four days earlier on Munich Street. 

“That’s why you went for a closer look,” Rudy said, “with the bread 
that day. To see if he was there.” 

“Yes.” 
“Crucified Christ.” 
“Yes.” 

The trees were tall and triangular. They were quiet. 

Liesel pulled The Word Shaker from her bag and showed Rudy one 
of the pages. On it was a boy with three medals hanging around his 
throat. 

“ ‘Hair the color of lemons,’ ” Rudy read. His fingers touched the 
words. “You told him about me?” 

At first, Liesel could not talk. Perhaps it was the sudden bumpiness 
of love she felt for him. Or had she always loved him? It’s likely. 
Restricted as she was from speaking, she wanted him to kiss her. She 
wanted him to drag her hand across and pull her over. It didn’t 
matter where. Her mouth, her neck, her cheek. Her skin was empty 
for it, waiting. 

Years ago, when they’d raced on a muddy field, Rudy was a hastily 
assembled set of bones, with a jagged, rocky smile. In the trees this 
afternoon, he was a giver of bread and teddy bears. He was a triple 
Hitler Youth athletics champion. He was her best friend. And he was 
a month from his death. 

“Of course I told him about you,” Liesel said. 
She was saying goodbye and she didn’t even know it. 

ILSA HERMANN’S LITTLE BLACK BOOK 

In mid-August, she thought she was going to 8 Grande Strasse for the 
same old remedy. 

To cheer herself up. 
That was what she thought. 

The day had been hot, but showers were predicted for the evening. In 
The Last Human Stranger, there was a quote near the end. Liesel was 
reminded of it as she walked past Frau Diller’s. 

e e e THE LAST HUMAN STRANGER, ++» 
PAGE 211 
The sun stirs the earth. Around and 
around, it stirs us, like stew. 

At the time, Liesel only thought of it because the day was so warm. 

On Munich Street, she remembered the events of the previous week 
there. She saw the Jews coming down the road, their streams and 
numbers and pain. She decided there was a word missing from her 
quote. 

The world is an ugly stew, she thought. 
It’s so ugly I can’t stand it. 

Liesel crossed the bridge over the Amper River. The water was 
glorious and emerald and rich. She could see the stones at the bottom 
and hear the familiar song of water. The world did not deserve such a 
river. 

She scaled the hill up to Grande Strasse. The houses were lovely 
and loathsome. She enjoyed the small ache in her legs and lungs. 
Walk harder, she thought, and she started rising, like a monster out of 
the sand. She smelled the neighborhood grass. It was fresh and sweet, 
green and yellow-tipped. She crossed the yard without a single turn of 
the head or the slightest pause of paranoia. 

The window. 
Hands on the frame, scissor of the legs. 
Landing feet. 
Books and pages and a happy place. 

She slid a book from the shelf and sat with it on the floor. 

Is she home? she wondered, but she did not care if Ilsa Hermann 
was slicing potatoes in the kitchen or lining up in the post office. Or 
standing ghost-like over the top of her, examining what the girl was 
reading. 
The girl simply didn’t care anymore. 
For a long time, she sat and saw. 

She had seen her brother die with one eye open, one still in a 
dream. She had said goodbye to her mother and imagined her lonely 
wait for a train back home to oblivion. A woman of wire had laid 
herself down, her scream traveling the street, till it fell sideways like 
a rolling coin starved of momentum. A young man was hung by a 
rope made of Stalingrad snow. She had watched a bomber pilot die in 
a metal case. She had seen a Jewish man who had twice given her the 
most beautiful pages of her life marched to a concentration camp. 
And at the center of all of it, she saw the Fuhrer shouting his words 
and passing them around. 

Those images were the world, and it stewed in her as she sat with 
the lovely books and their manicured titles. It brewed in her as she 
eyed the pages full to the brims of their bellies with paragraphs and 

words. 
You bastards, she thought. 
You lovely bastards. 

Don’t make me happy. Please, don’t fill me up and let me think that 
something good can come of any of this. Look at my bruises. Look at 
this graze. Do you see the graze inside me? Do you see it growing 
before your very eyes, eroding me? I don’t want to hope for anything 
anymore. I don’t want to pray that Max is alive and safe. Or Alex 
Steiner. 

Because the world does not deserve them. 

She tore a page from the book and ripped it in half. 
Then a chapter. 

Soon, there was nothing but scraps of words littered between her 
legs and all around her. The words. Why did they have to exist? 
Without them, there wouldn’t be any of this. Without words, the 
Fuhrer was nothing. There would be no limping prisoners, no need for 
consolation or wordly tricks to make us feel better. 
What good were the words? 

She said it audibly now, to the orange-lit room. “What good are the 
words?” 

The book thief stood and walked carefully to the library door. Its 
protest was small and halfhearted. The airy hallway was steeped in 
wooden emptiness. 

“Frau Hermann?” 

The question came back at her and tried for another surge to the 
front door. It made it only halfway, landing weakly on a couple of fat 
floorboards. 

“Frau Hermann?” 
The calls were greeted with nothing but silence, and she was 

tempted to seek out the kitchen, for Rudy. She refrained. It wouldn’t 
have felt right to steal food from a woman who had left her a 
dictionary against a windowpane. That, and she had also just 
destroyed one of her books, page by page, chapter by chapter. She’d 
done enough damage as it was. 

Liesel returned to the library and opened one of the desk drawers. 
She sat down. 

e e ¢ THE LAST LETTER « « « 
Dear Mrs. Hermann, 

As you can see, I have been in your library again and I have 
ruined one of your books. I was just so angry and afraid and I 
wanted to kill the words. I have stolen from you and now I’ve 
wrecked your property. I’m sorry. To punish myself, I think I 
will stop coming here. Or is it punishment at all? I love this 
place and hate it, because it is full of words. 

You have been a friend to me even though I hurt you, even 
though I have been insufferable (a word I looked up in your 
dictionary), and I think I will leave you alone now. I’m sorry for 
everything. 
Thank you again. 

Liesel Meminger 

She left the note on the desk and gave the room a last goodbye, doing 
three laps and running her hands over the titles. As much as she 
hated them, she couldn’t resist. Flakes of torn-up paper were strewn 
around a book called The Rules of Tommy Hoffmann. In the breeze 
from the window, a few of its shreds rose and fell. 

The light was still orange, but it was not as lustrous as earlier. Her 
hands felt their final grip of the wooden window frame, and there 

was the last rush of a plunging stomach, and the pang of pain in her 
feet when she landed. 

By the time she made it down the hill and across the bridge, the 
orange light had vanished. Clouds were mopping up. 

When she walked down Himmel Street, she could already feel the 
first drops of rain. I will never see Ilsa Hermann again, she thought, 
but the book thief was better at reading and ruining books than 
making assumptions. 

e e ¢ THREE DAYS LATER « « « 
The woman has knocked at number 
thirty-three and waits for a reply. 

It was strange for Liesel to see her without the bathrobe. The summer 
dress was yellow with red trim. There was a pocket with a small 
flower on it. No swastikas. Black shoes. Never before had she noticed 
Ilsa Hermann’s shins. She had porcelain legs. 

“Frau Hermann, I’m sorry—for what I did the last time in the 
library.” 
The woman quieted her. She reached into her bag and pulled out a 
small black book. Inside was not a story, but lined paper. “I thought if 
you're not going to read any more of my books, you might like to 
write one instead. Your letter, it was ...” She handed the book to 
Liesel with both hands. “You can certainly write. You write well.” The 
book was heavy, the cover matted like The Shoulder Shrug. “And 
please,” Ilsa Hermann advised her, “don’t punish yourself, like you 
said you would. Don’t be like me, Liesel.” 
The girl opened the book and touched the paper. “Danke schon, 
Frau Hermann. I can make you some coffee, if you like. Would you 
come in? I’m home alone. My mama’s next door, with Frau 
Holtzapfel.” 

“Shall we use the door or the window?” 

Liesel suspected it was the broadest smile Ilsa Hermann had 
allowed herself in years. “I think we’ll use the door. It’s easier.” 

They sat in the kitchen. 
Coffee mugs and bread with jam. They struggled to speak and 
Liesel could hear Ilsa Hermann swallow, but somehow, it was not 
uncomfortable. It was even nice to see the woman gently blow across 
the coffee to cool it. 
“If I ever write something and finish it,” Liesel said, “Pll show you.” 

“That would be nice.” 

When the mayor’s wife left, Liesel watched her walk up Himmel 
Street. She watched her yellow dress and her black shoes and her 
porcelain legs. 

At the mailbox, Rudy asked, “Was that who I think it was?” 
“Yes.” 
“You’re joking.” 
“She gave me a present.” 

As it turned out, Ilsa Hermann not only gave Liesel Meminger a book 
that day. She also gave her a reason to spend time in the basement— 
her favorite place, first with Papa, then Max. She gave her a reason to 
write her own words, to see that words had also brought her to life. 

“Don’t punish yourself,” she heard her say again, but there would 
be punishment and pain, and there would be happiness, too. That was 
writing. 

In the night, when Mama and Papa were asleep, Liesel crept down to 
the basement and turned on the kerosene lamp. For the first hour, she 
only watched the pencil and paper. She made herself remember, and 
as was her habit, she did not look away. 

“Schreibe,” she instructed herself. “Write.” 

After more than two hours, Liesel Meminger started writing, not 
knowing how she was ever going to get this right. How could she ever 
know that someone would pick her story up and carry it with him 
everywhere? 

No one expects these things. 
They don’t plan them. 

She used a small paint can for a seat, a large one as a table, and Liesel 
stuck the pencil onto the first page. In the middle, she wrote the 
following. 

e e e THE BOOK THIEF « « « 
a small story 
by 
Liesel Meminger 

THE RIB-CAGE PLANES 

Her hand was sore by page three. 

Words are so heavy, she thought, but as the night wore on, she was 
able to complete eleven pages. 

« e « PAGE1<¢°-« 
I try to ignore it, but I know this all 
started with the train and the snow and my 
coughing brother. I stole my first book that 
day. It was a manual for digging graves and 
I stole it on my way to Himmel Street .... 

She fell asleep down there, on a bed of drop sheets, with the paper 
curling at the edges, up on the taller paint can. In the morning, Mama 
stood above her, her chlorinated eyes questioning. 

“Liesel,” she said, “what on earth are you doing down here?” 
“Tm writing, Mama.” 
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” Rosa stomped back up the steps. “Be 
back up in five minutes or you get the bucket treatment. Verstehst?” 
“T understand.” 

Every night, Liesel made her way down to the basement. She kept the 
book with her at all times. For hours, she wrote, attempting each 
night to complete ten pages of her life. There was so much to 
consider, so many things in danger of being left out. Just be patient, 
she told herself, and with the mounting pages, the strength of her 
writing fist grew. 

Sometimes she wrote about what was happening in the basement at 
the time of writing. She had just finished the moment when Papa had 
slapped her on the church steps and how they’d “heil Hitlered” 
together. Looking across, Hans Hubermann was packing the 
accordion away. He’d just played for half an hour as Liesel wrote. 

s e e PAGE 42°% 
Papa sat with me tonight. He brought the 
accordion down and sat close to where Max 
used to sit. I often look at his fingers and 
face when he plays. The accordion breathes. 
There are lines on his cheeks. They look drawn 
on, and for some reason, when I see them, 
I want to cry. It is not for any sadness or 
pride. I just like the way they moye and 
change. Sometimes I think my papa is an 
accordion. When he looks at me and smiles 
and breathes, I hear the notes. 

After ten nights of writing, Munich was bombed again. Liesel was up 
and was asleep in the basement. She did not hear the cuckoo or the 
sirens, and she was holding the book in her sleep when Papa came to 
wake her. “Liesel, come.” She took The Book Thief and each of her 
other books, and they fetched Frau Holtzapfel. 

s e e PAGE 175°% 
A book floated down the Amper River. 
A boy jumped in, caught up to it, and held 
it in his right hand. He grinned. He stood 
waist-deep in the icy, Decemberish water. 

“How about a kiss, Saumensch?” he said. 

By the next raid, on October 2, she was finished. Only a few dozen 
pages remained blank and the book thief was already starting to read 
over what she’d written. The book was divided into ten parts, all of 
which were given the title of books or stories and described how each 
affected her life. 

Often, I wonder what page she was up to when I walked down 
Himmel Street in the dripping-tap rain, five nights later. I wonder 
what she was reading when the first bomb dropped from the rib cage 
of a plane. 

Personally, I like to imagine her looking briefly at the wall, at Max 
Vandenburg’s tightrope cloud, his dripping sun, and the figures 
walking toward it. Then she looks at the agonizing attempts of her 
paint-written spelling. I see the Führer coming down the basement 
steps with his tied-together boxing gloves hanging casually around his 
neck. And the book thief reads, rereads, and rereads her last sentence, 
for many hours. 

e e e THE BOOK THIEF—LAST LINE + « « 
I have hated the words and 
I have loved them, 
and I hope I have made them right. 

Outside, the world whistled. The rain was stained. 

THE END OF THE WORLD (Part II) 

Almost all the words are fading now. The black book is disintegrating 
under the weight of my travels. That’s another reason for telling this 
story. What did we say earlier? Say something enough times and you 
never forget it. Also, I can tell you what happened after the book 
thief’s words had stopped, and how I came to know her story in the 
first place. Like this. 

Picture yourself walking down Himmel Street in the dark. Your hair is 
getting wet and the air pressure is on the verge of drastic change. The 
first bomb hits Tommy Muller’s apartment block. His face twitches 
innocently in his sleep and I kneel at his bed. Next, his sister. 
Kristina’s feet are sticking out from under the blanket. They match 
the hopscotch footprints on the street. Her little toes. Their mother 
sleeps a few feet away. Four cigarettes sit disfigured in her ashtray, 
and the roofless ceiling is hot plate red. Himmel Street is burning. 

The sirens began to howl. 

“Too late now,” I whispered, “for that little exercise,” because 
everyone had been fooled, and fooled again. First up, the Allies had 
feigned a raid on Munich in order to strike at Stuttgart. But next, ten 
planes had remained. Oh, there were warnings, all right. In Molching, 
they came with the bombs. 

e e eA ROLL CALL OF STREETS « « « 
Munich, Ellenberg, Johannson, Himmel. 
The main street + three more, 
in the poorer part of town. 

In the space of a few minutes, all of them were gone. 
A church was chopped down. 
Earth was destroyed where Max Vandenburg had stayed on his feet. 

At 31 Himmel Street, Frau Holtzapfel appeared to be waiting for me 
in the kitchen. A broken cup was in front of her and in a last moment 
of awakeness, her face seemed to ask just what in the hell had taken 
me so long. 

By contrast, Frau Diller was fast asleep. Her bulletproof glasses 
were shattered next to the bed. Her shop was obliterated, the counter 
landing across the road, and her framed photo of Hitler was taken 
from the wall and thrown to the floor. The man was positively 
mugged and beaten to a glass-shattering pulp. I stepped on him on 
my way out. 

The Fiedlers were well organized, all in bed, all covered. Pfiffikus 
was hidden up to his nose. 

At the Steiners’, I ran my fingers through Barbara’s lovely combed 
hair, I took the serious look from Kurt’s serious sleeping face, and one 
by one, I kissed the smaller ones good night. 

Then Rudy. 

Oh, crucified Christ, Rudy ... 

He lay in bed with one of his sisters. She must have kicked him or 
muscled her way into the majority of the bed space because he was 
on the very edge with his arm around her. The boy slept. His candlelit 
hair ignited the bed, and I picked both him and Bettina up with their 
souls still in the blanket. If nothing else, they died fast and they were 
warm. The boy from the plane, I thought. The one with the teddy 
bear. Where was Rudy’s comfort? Where was someone to alleviate 

this robbery of his life? Who was there to soothe him as life’s rug was 
snatched from under his sleeping feet? 

No one. 
There was only me. 

And I’m not too great at that sort of comforting thing, especially 
when my hands are cold and the bed is warm. I carried him softly 
through the broken street, with one salty eye and a heavy, deathly 
heart. With him, I tried a little harder. I watched the contents of his 
soul for a moment and saw a black-painted boy calling the name 
Jesse Owens as he ran through an imaginary tape. I saw him hip-deep 
in some icy water, chasing a book, and I saw a boy lying in bed, 
imagining how a kiss would taste from his glorious next-door 
neighbor. He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It’s his only 
detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry. 

Lastly, the Hubermanns. 
Hans. 
Papa. 

He was tall in the bed and I could see the silver through his eyelids. 
His soul sat up. It met me. Those kinds of souls always do—the best 
ones. The ones who rise up and say, “I know who you are and I am 
ready. Not that I want to go, of course, but I will come.” Those souls 
are always light because more of them have been put out. More of 
them have already found their way to other places. This one was sent 
out by the breath of an accordion, the odd taste of champagne in 
summer, and the art of promise-keeping. He lay in my arms and 
rested. There was an itchy lung for a last cigarette and an immense, 
magnetic pull toward the basement, for the girl who was his daughter 
and was writing a book down there that he hoped to read one day. 

Liesel. 

His soul whispered it as I carried him. But there was no Liesel in 
that house. Not for me, anyway. 

For me, there was only a Rosa, and yes, I truly think I picked her 
up midsnore, for her mouth was open and her papery pink lips were 
still in the act of moving. If she’d seen me, I’m sure she would have 
called me a Saukerl, though I would not have taken it badly. After 
reading The Book Thief, I discovered that she called everyone that. 
Saukerl. Saumensch. Especially the people she loved. Her elastic hair 
was out. It rubbed against the pillow and her wardrobe body had 
risen with the beating of her heart. Make no mistake, the woman had 
a heart. She had a bigger one than people would think. There was a 
lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that 
she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the 
long, moon-slit night. She was a Jew feeder without a question in the 
world on a man’s first night in Molching. And she was an arm 
reacher, deep into a mattress, to deliver a sketchbook to a teenage 
girl. 

e e e THE LASTLUCK « « « 
I moved from street to street and 
came back for a single man named 
Schultz at the bottom of Himmel. 

He couldn’t hold out inside the collapsed house, and I was carrying 
his soul up Himmel Street when I noticed the LSE shouting and 
laughing. 
There was a small valley in the mountain range of rubble. 

The hot sky was red and turning. Pepper streaks were starting to 
swirl and I became curious. Yes, yes, I know what I told you at the 
beginning. Usually my curiosity leads to the dreaded witnessing of 
some kind of human outcry, but on this occasion, I have to say that 
although it broke my heart, I was, and still am, glad I was there. 

When they pulled her out, it’s true that she started to wail and scream 
for Hans Hubermann. The men of the LSE attempted to keep her in 
their powdery arms, but the book thief managed to break away. 
Desperate humans often seem able to do this. 

She did not know where she was running, for Himmel Street no 
longer existed. Everything was new and apocalyptic. Why was the sky 
red? How could it be snowing? And why did the snowflakes burn her 
arms? 

Liesel slowed to a staggering walk and concentrated up ahead. 
Where’s Frau Diller’s? she thought. Where’s— 

She wandered a short while longer until the man who found her 
took her arm and kept talking. “You’re just in shock, my girl. It’s just 
shock; yow’re going to be fine.” 

“What’s happened?” Liesel asked. “Is this still Himmel Street?” 

“Yes.” The man had disappointed eyes. What had he seen these past 
few years? “This is Himmel. You got bombed, my girl. Es tut mir leid, 
Schatzi. I’m sorry, darling.” 

The girl’s mouth wandered on, even if her body was now still. She 
had forgotten her previous wails for Hans Hubermann. That was years 
ago—a bombing will do that. She said, “We have to get my papa, my 
mama. We have to get Max out of the basement. If he’s not there, he’s 
in the hallway, looking out the window. He does that sometimes 
when there’s a raid—he doesn’t get to look much at the sky, you see. I 
have to tell him how the weather looks now. He’ll never believe me 

99 

Her body buckled at that moment and the LSE man caught her and 
sat her down. “We’ll move her in a minute,” he told his sergeant. The 
book thief looked at what was heavy and hurting in her hand. 

The book. 
The words. 
Her fingers were bleeding, just like they had on her arrival here. 

The LSE man lifted her and started to lead her away. A wooden spoon 
was on fire. A man walked past with a broken accordion case and 
Liesel could see the instrument inside. She could see its white teeth 
and the black notes in between. They smiled at her and triggered an 
alertness to her reality. We were bombed, she thought, and now she 
turned to the man at her side and said, “That’s my papa’s accordion.” 
Again. “That’s my papa’s accordion.” 

“Don’t worry, young girl, you’re safe; just come a little farther.” 
But Liesel did not come. 

She looked to where the man was taking the accordion and 
followed him. With the red sky still showering its beautiful ash, she 
stopped the tall LSE worker and said, “I'll take that if you like—it’s 
my papa’s.” Softly, she took it from the man’s hand and began 
carrying it off. It was right about then that she saw the first body. 

The accordion case fell from her grip. The sound of an explosion. 
Frau Holtzapfel was scissored on the ground. 

e e e THE NEXT DOZEN SECONDS « « « 
OF LIESEL MEMINGER’S LIFE 
She turns on her heel and looks as far 
as she can down this ruined canal 
that was once Himmel Street. She sees two 
men carrying a body and she follows them. 

When she saw the rest of them, Liesel coughed. She listened 
momentarily as a man told the others that they had found one of the 
bodies in pieces, in one of the maple trees. 

There were shocked pajamas and torn faces. It was the boy’s hair 
she saw first. 

Rudy? 

She did more than mouth the word now. “Rudy?” 

He lay with yellow hair and closed eyes, and the book thief ran 
toward him and fell down. She dropped the black book. “Rudy,” she 
sobbed, “wake up ....” She grabbed him by his shirt and gave him just 
the slightest disbelieving shake. “Wake up, Rudy,” and now, as the 
sky went on heating and showering ash, Liesel was holding Rudy 
Steiner’s shirt by the front. “Rudy, please.” The tears grappled with 
her face. “Rudy, please, wake up, Goddamn it, wake up, I love you. 
Come on, Rudy, come on, Jesse Owens, don’t you know I love you, 
wake up, wake up, wake up ....” 

But nothing cared. 

The rubble just climbed higher. Concrete hills with caps of red. A 
beautiful, tear-stomped girl, shaking the dead. 

“Come on, Jesse Owens—” 
But the boy did not wake. 

In disbelief, Liesel buried her head into Rudy’s chest. She held his 
limp body, trying to keep him from lolling back, until she needed to 
return him to the butchered ground. She did it gently. 

Slow. Slow. 
“God, Rudy ...” 

She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Liesel kissed 
her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty 
and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the 
glow of the anarchist’s suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, 
and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her 
fingers. Her hands were trembling, her lips were fleshy, and she 
leaned in once more, this time losing control and misjudging it. Their 
teeth collided on the demolished world of Himmel Street. 

She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more 
minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It 
amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing 
down their faces and they stagger on, coughing and searching, and 
finding. 

e ¢ ¢ THE NEXT DISCOVERY « « ù 
The bodies of Mama and Papa, 
both lying tangled in the gravel 
bedsheet of Himmel Street 

Liesel did not run or walk or move at all. Her eyes had scoured the 
humans and stopped hazily when she noticed the tall man and the 
short, wardrobe woman. That’s my mama. That’s my papa. The words 
were stapled to her. 

“They’re not moving,” she said quietly. “They’re not moving.” 

Perhaps if she stood still long enough, it would be they who moved, 
but they remained motionless for as long as Liesel did. I realized at 
that moment that she was not wearing any shoes. What an odd thing 
to notice right then. Perhaps I was trying to avoid her face, for the 
book thief was truly an irretrievable mess. 

She took a step and didn’t want to take any more, but she did. 
Slowly, Liesel walked to her mama and papa and sat down between 
them. She held Mama’s hand and began speaking to her. “Remember 
when I came here, Mama? I clung to the gate and cried. Do you 
remember what you said to everyone on the street that day?” Her 
voice wavered now. “You said, ‘What are you assholes looking at?’ ” 
She took Mama’s hand and touched her wrist. “Mama, I know that 
you ... I liked when you came to school and told me Max had woken 
up. Did you know I saw you with Papa’s accordion?” She tightened 
her grip on the hardening hand. “I came and watched and you were 
beautiful. Goddamn it, you were so beautiful, Mama.” 

s © ¢ MANY MOMENTS OF AVOIDANCE « « « 
Papa. She would not, and 
could not, look at Papa. 
Not yet. Not now. 

Papa was a man with silver eyes, not dead ones. 
Papa was an accordion! 
But his bellows were all empty. 
Nothing went in and nothing came out. 

She began to rock back and forth. A shrill, quiet, smearing note was 
caught somewhere in her mouth until she was finally able to turn. 

To Papa. 

At that point, I couldn’t help it. I walked around to see her better, and 
from the moment I witnessed her face again, I could tell that this was 
who she loved the most. Her expression stroked the man on his face. 
It followed one of the lines down his cheek. He had sat in the 
washroom with her and taught her how to roll a cigarette. He gave 
bread to a dead man on Munich Street and told the girl to keep 
reading in the bomb shelter. Perhaps if he didn’t, she might not have 
ended up writing in the basement. 

Papa—the accordionist—and Himmel Street. 

One could not exist without the other, because for Liesel, both were 
home. Yes, that’s what Hans Hubermann was for Liesel Meminger. 

She turned around and spoke to the LSE. 
“Please,” she said, “my papa’s accordion. Could you get it for me?” 

After a few minutes of confusion, an older member brought the 
eaten case and Liesel opened it. She removed the injured instrument 
and laid it next to Papa’s body. “Here, Papa.” 

And I can promise you something, because it was a thing I saw 
many years later—a vision in the book thief herself—that as she knelt 
next to Hans Hubermann, she watched him stand and play the 
accordion. He stood and strapped it on in the alps of broken houses 
and played the accordion with kindness silver eyes and even a 
cigarette slouched on his lips. He even made a mistake and laughed in 

lovely hindsight. The bellows breathed and the tall man played for 
Liesel Meminger one last time as the sky was slowly taken from the 
stove. 

Keep playing, Papa. 
Papa stopped. 

He dropped the accordion and his silver eyes continued to rust. 
There was only a body now, on the ground, and Liesel lifted him up 
and hugged him. She wept over the shoulder of Hans Hubermann. 
Goodbye, Papa, you saved me. You taught me to read. No one can 
play like you. Ill never drink champagne. No one can play like you. 
Her arms held him. She kissed his shoulder—she couldn’t bear to 
look at his face anymore—and she placed him down again. 

The book thief wept till she was gently taken away. 

Later, they remembered the accordion but no one noticed the book. 

There was much work to be done, and with a collection of other 
materials, The Book Thief was stepped on several times and eventually 
picked up without even a glance and thrown aboard a garbage truck. 
Just before the truck left, I climbed quickly up and took it in my hand 

It’s lucky I was there. 

Then again, who am I kidding? I’m in most places at least once, and 
in 1943, I was just about everywhere.

DEATH AND LIESEL 

It has been many years since all of that, but there is still plenty of 
work to do. I can promise you that the world is a factory. The sun 
stirs it, the humans rule it. And I remain. I carry them away. 

As for what’s left of this story, I will not skirt around any of it, 
because I’m tired, I’m so tired, and I will tell it as straightly as I can. 

e e e A LAST FACT * « « 
I should tell you that 
the book thief died 
only yesterday. 

Liesel Meminger lived to a very old age, far away from Molching and 
the demise of Himmel Street. 
She died in a suburb of Sydney. The house number was forty-five— 
the same as the Fiedlers’ shelter—and the sky was the best blue of 
afternoon. Like her papa, her soul was sitting up. 

In her final visions, she saw her three children, her grandchildren, her 
husband, and the long list of lives that merged with hers. Among 
them, lit like lanterns, were Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her brother, 
and the boy whose hair remained the color of lemons forever. 

But a few other visions were there as well. 
Come with me and I'll tell you a story. 

Pll show you something. 

WOOD IN THE AFTERNOON 

When Himmel Street was cleared, Liesel Meminger had nowhere to 
go. She was the girl they referred to as “the one with the accordion,” 
and she was taken to the police, who were in the throes of deciding 
what to do with her. 
She sat on a very hard chair. The accordion looked at her through 
the hole in the case. 
It took three hours in the police station for the mayor and a fluffy- 
haired woman to show their faces. “Everyone says there’s a girl,” the 
lady said, “who survived on Himmel Street.” 

A policeman pointed. 

Ilsa Hermann offered to carry the case, but Liesel held it firmly in her 
hand as they walked down the police station steps. A few blocks 
down Munich Street, there was a clear line separating the bombed 
from the fortunate. 

The mayor drove. 
Ilsa sat with her in the back. 

The girl let her hold her hand on top of the accordion case, which 
sat between them. 

It would have been easy to say nothing, but Liesel had the opposite 
reaction to her devastation. She sat in the exquisite spare room of the 
mayor’s house and spoke and spoke—to herself—well into the night. 
She ate very little. The only thing she didn’t do at all was wash. 

For four days, she carried around the remains of Himmel Street on 

the carpets and floorboards of 8 Grande Strasse. She slept a lot and 
didn’t dream, and on most occasions she was sorry to wake up. 
Everything disappeared when she was asleep. 
On the day of the funerals, she still hadn’t bathed, and Ilsa 
Hermann asked politely if she’d like to. Previously, she’d only shown 
her the bath and given her a towel. 
People who were at the service of Hans and Rosa Hubermann 
always talked about the girl who stood there wearing a pretty dress 
and a layer of Himmel Street dirt. There was also a rumor that later 
in the day, she walked fully clothed into the Amper River and said 
something very strange. 
Something about a kiss. 
Something about a Saumensch. 
How many times did she have to say goodbye? 

After that, there were weeks and months, and a lot of war. She 
remembered her books in the moments of worst sorrow, especially 
the ones that were made for her and the one that saved her life. One 
morning, in a renewed state of shock, she even walked back down to 
Himmel Street to find them, but nothing was left. There was no 
recovery from what had happened. That would take decades; it would 
take a long life. 

There were two ceremonies for the Steiner family. The first was 
immediately upon their burial. The second was as soon as Alex 
Steiner made it home, when he was given leave after the bombing. 

Since the news had found him, Alex had been whittled away. 
“Crucified Christ,” he’d said, “if only I’'d let Rudy go to that school.” 
You save someone. 
You kill them. 
How was he supposed to know? 

The only thing he truly did know was that he’d have done anything 
to have been on Himmel Street that night so that Rudy survived 
rather than himself. 

That was something he told Liesel on the steps of 8 Grande Strasse, 
when he rushed up there after hearing of her survival. 

That day, on the steps, Alex Steiner was sawn apart. 

Liesel told him that she had kissed Rudy’s lips. It embarrassed her, 
but she thought he might have liked to know. There were wooden 
teardrops and an oaky smile. In Liesel’s vision, the sky I saw was gray 
and glossy. A silver afternoon. 

MAX 

When the war was over and Hitler had delivered himself to my arms, 
Alex Steiner resumed work in his tailor shop. There was no money in 
it, but he busied himself there for a few hours each day, and Liesel 
often accompanied him. They spent many days together, often 
walking to Dachau after its liberation, only to be denied by the 
Americans. 

Finally, in October 1945, a man with swampy eyes, feathers of hair, 
and a clean-shaven face walked into the shop. He approached the 
counter. “Is there someone here by the name of Liesel Meminger?” 

“Yes, she’s in the back,” said Alex. He was hopeful, but he wanted 
to be sure. “May I ask who is calling on her?” 

Liesel came out. 
They hugged and cried and fell to the floor. 

THE HANDOVER MAN 

Yes, I have seen a great many things in this world. I attend the 
greatest disasters and work for the greatest villains. 
But then there are other moments. 
There’s a multitude of stories (a mere handful, as I have previously 
suggested) that I allow to distract me as I work, just as the colors do. I 
pick them up in the unluckiest, unlikeliest places and I make sure to 
remember them as I go about my work. The Book Thief is one such 
story. 

When I traveled to Sydney and took Liesel away, I was finally able to 
do something Id been waiting on for a long time. I put her down and 
we walked along Anzac Avenue, near the soccer field, and I pulled a 
dusty black book from my pocket. 

The old woman was astonished. She took it in her hand and said, 
“Ts this really it?” 

I nodded. 

With great trepidation, she opened The Book Thief and turned the 
pages. “I can’t believe ...” Even though the text had faded, she was 
able to read her words. The fingers of her soul touched the story that 
was written so long ago in her Himmel Street basement. 

She sat down on the curb, and I joined her. 

“Did you read it?” she asked, but she did not look at me. Her eyes 
were fixed to the words. 

I nodded. “Many times.” 
“Could you understand it?” 
And at that point, there was a great pause. 
A few cars drove by, each way. Their drivers were Hitlers and 

Hubermanns, and Maxes, killers, Dillers, and Steiners .... 

I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and 
brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn’t 
already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly 
overestimating and underestimating the human race—that rarely do I 
ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could 
be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and 
brilliant. 

None of those things, however, came out of my mouth. 

All I was able to do was turn to Liesel Meminger and tell her the 
only truth I truly know. I said it to the book thief and I say it now to 
you.

THE 

BOOK 




ANNIVERSARY-EDITION 
BONUS MATERIAL 

introduction 

From the simplest point of view, I started writing The Book Thief in 
the Australian winter of 2001 and finished it almost exactly three 
years later, in August 2004. I still remember staying up all night to 
get it done, and I realize that’s always the best time to finish a book. 
The sun is yet to come up. It seems the whole world is asleep, and 
there you are, on your own, with the pages set before you. For a 
writer, there’s no other place you’d rather be, because you know how 
hard it is to get there—and you might never get there, the same way, 
again. 
From another point of view, though, I started writing The Book 
Thief long before I ever knew I wanted to be a writer. It began in the 
kitchen as a young boy, hearing the stories of my parents, as they told 
them to my sisters, my brother, and me. They never sat us down and 
said, “Now we'll tell you where you come from” or “Come here, we 
have something to say.” It was always with the spontaneity that 
triggers the best stories. A conversation would remind them of 
something that happened when they were children, growing up 
outside Munich and Vienna. And what stories they had to tell. 

It didn’t dawn on me how lucky I was until after The Book Thief was 
published. It was then that I realized that not only did my parents 
both have amazing stories, but they were both superb storytellers. 
That combination is rare in one person you know, let alone in the two 
people you’re closest to. For my siblings and me, when we heard 
those stories, it was like a piece of Europe entered our kitchen. We 
were shown a world of bombs and ice and fire. We were told about 
kids boycotting Hitler Youth meetings, and mothers and fathers who 
refused to fly the Nazi flag. We heard about boys who were whipped 
for giving bread to Jewish people and other so-called criminals, as 
they were marched through the streets of their town—and the way 
those people thanked them. 

How could I ever know? 

My parents weren’t only telling me about what they saw. They 
were teaching me how to write. 

first ideas 

First ideas are usually rubbish—or at least, mine are. 
I should probably start with that. 

In the case of The Book Thief, I'd first thought about writing about 
my mother’s upbringing during and after World War II, in Germany. 
It wasn’t going to be fiction. I had two titles in mind. The first was the 
name of a radio program that was aired by the American soldiers who 
occupied Munich when the war ended. The show was called Luncheon 
in Mtinchen. It seems a pretty awful title for a book all these years 
later. I’m grateful I didn’t use it. 

Next, I imagined calling the book It’s Alright, Ma, after the Dylan 
song “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding).” Again, it was just a 
fleeting thought. 
What I should point out is that I hadn’t started the project yet. The 
book was just somewhere in the background, watching me. I often 
feel like that—that a story is watching from somewhere, waiting for 
the right moment to stand in front of you. The thing is, you’ll only 
recognize it if you think about it enough. It’ll come. 

Like I said, that was all very early. My first book had just been 
published. I knew it wasn’t time to attempt this book yet; I still had a 
lot to learn. 

A few years later, when I did contemplate a beginning, I knew it 
would have to be a work of fiction. In the time in between, I’d 
collected three central ideas. One came under the blanket of my 
parents’ stories. The second was about a girl stealing books. The third 
was that maybe Death would be the narrator. In the writing of any 
book, you throw out more ideas than you can ever count. Those were 
three that I kept. 

Looking at this list, I see some of the titles that didn’t make 
it, like “roo Miles from Moscow,” “The Sugar Cone,” and 
“Forty-Six Minutes: Telling Rudy About Max.” (That last one 
was moved to Part Ten and renamed “Confessions. ”) 


framework 

One of the first things I do when I start working on any book is to 
write out chapter headings—and I seem to do this hundreds of times, 
all the way through to the end. I don’t write a detailed plan, because I 
know what a chapter should do just by looking at its title. The order 
of chapters will change many times, and often they’ll revert back. 
Everything has its right place. 

The other reason I do this kind of listing is to confine myself in 
some way. It gives me a framework to work inside, without stepping 
out for good reason. For me, writing is much more mathematical than 
people might think. 

To use The Book Thief as an example, writing out the chapter 
headings gave me a structure of eighty-eight chapters—four in both 
the prologue and epilogue, and then eight chapters in each of the 
book’s ten parts. All of those numbers are important; I knew the size 
of the playing field. It’s the same with the spacing, the page settings— 
everything. 
In the manuscript, the font is Courier New. 
The size is ten, set in bold. 
The spacing is 1.3. 

I can’t remember what I did with the left and right margins, but 
you can bet I mucked around with them till I was completely 
satisfied. All of these things change for every book. I want everything 
around the book to be working in a specific way. That’s how I know I 
can show up at my desk feeling happy, and ready. I won’t have a 
single excuse. 

When I went through all of my loose sheets of paper, 
I found hundreds of lists like this one. Getting the time 
frame of the years was also important. 


finding death 

One of the good things about having multiple notebooks is that if 
you're lucky, you'll find at least one of them at a time like this. I 
remember using the one pictured here when I was starting the book 
all over again (which happens hundreds of times throughout the 
whole writing process—not an exaggeration). 

This handwritten beginning is probably one of the last rewrites 
before I introduced Death’s announcements. That arrived one night 
when I was reading it over, and I heard something inside me as I 
stared at the page. 

s e e HERE IS A SMALL FACT « « « 
You are going to die. 

When you hear an inner voice like that, you don’t ask questions. 
You just do it. This idea added to a thought I’d had where I wanted 
Death to tell a story slightly either side of the way a human does. It 
felt right. So I kept it. 

The same goes for Death’s strange use of language. Having him 
narrate freed me to describe things (especially colors) in a way that 
was unusual but oddly familiar. I also decided that Death would refer 
to the sky, the clouds, the trees, and the earth in terms of who. I 
wanted him to talk about those things as if they were colleagues—as 
if all the elements of the world, and life and death, are just part of the 
same thing. 

I wanted Death to be the missing piece of us.

Most of the way through the first draft, my intention was 
for Liesel to be arrested at the end for stealing. That’s why 
the prologue title here is “Homesick for a Prison Cell.” 


death vs. liesel vs. third-person narrator 

The truth is, for the first two years, I had a lot of trouble with Death 
as the narrator. At first he was too macabre; he was enjoying his work 
far too much. After a page of writing, I felt like I needed to take a 
shower—he was too sinister and typically death-like. 

My first solution was drastic: 
I scrapped Death altogether and decided Liesel should narrate. 

The new problem I had was that because I’m Australian, as the 
writing progressed, I now had the most Australian-sounding German 
girl in the history of all writing everywhere (despite my partly 
German upbringing). So I scrapped that idea and decided on simple, 
third-person narration. 

At that point, I was hit by another problem entirely. This kind of 
narration was everything Id been trying to avoid in the first 
place ... so I started to look at Death again. (Usually, if an idea keeps 
calling you back, it’s the right one.) But this time, I had one 
revelation that made all the difference. I thought of the last line of the 
book and realized: “That’s it! Death is haunted by us, and that’s how 
he should narrate.” I thought that the one chink in his armor should 
be that he is haunted by humans because he mostly finds us at our 
weakest, and our worst. He’s telling Liesel’s story to prove to himself 
that humans can be beautiful and selfless and worthwhile. 

When I started over (yes, again), I knew I had what I needed. It had 
taken two years to find the specific voice, and I was determined to 
write all the way through to the end.

I wrote about 150 pages with Liesel narrating, but it never

finding liesel 

One of the most commonly asked questions about The Book Thief is 
whether Liesel is my mother. The answer to that is no. There are 
elements, of course, of the girl my mother was, but as soon as one 
event is fictionalized, the character ceases to be the real person. When 
Liesel’s brother, Werner, dies on the train at the start—which wasn’t 
something that happened to my mother—Liesel became totally 
herself. I never viewed her as my mother again. Liesel was Liesel, and 
that was it. 

Probably the most honest thing I can say about Liesel is that she 
was one of the easier characters to write. It was getting everyone else 
working in combination with her that was the hard part. I always saw 
the book as a kind of love story, with Liesel at its center. There’s her 
love for Hans, Rosa, Rudy, Max, for life itself, and, of course, for 
books and stories. Each is a different kind of love—and each adds to 
the person she is, and becomes. 

It wasn’t until later that I noticed the underlying themes Liesel was 
bringing to the book. There was a point where I understood that she 
was stealing the words back, from Hitler and Nazi Germany. She was 
writing her own story through the world around her. Only then did I 
start to know what the book was truly about. You learn about a book 
as you write it, and I was lucky to have a character like Liesel to show 
the way. 

No matter how people react to The Book Thief; Liesel’s thought 
here pretty much sums up my own view. It’s exactly how you feel 

when a book is finally done. 


rudy and the great jesse owens 

There’s no doubt in my mind that I loved Rudy the most, out of a 
whole cast of characters I loved with everything in me. As it was, 
Rudy was a gift, and proof that sometimes research gives you the 
ultimate reward before you’ve even opened a book. 

It was very early on, but I knew the kids on Himmel Street would 
play soccer. I also wanted them to shout the names of famous soccer 
players of that era; they would commentate as they played. 

To find that sort of information, I began at my local library, and the 
search ended before it began. I can still remember vividly what 
happened. All I did was walk in and head toward the sports section, 
where I immediately saw the spine of a book on the Olympics. The 
faces of several famous athletes were printed on that spine, and one 
of them was Jesse Owens. I stopped. I felt the realization immediately 
and thought, “I don’t need any soccer players ....” I saw Rudy 
painting himself black with charcoal and running the hundred meters 
at the local sports field. It was one of those moments that I knew 
would define a character, and those moments are hard to find. 

In Rudy, I knew I had someone who was alive a hundred percent of 
the time. Even now I find myself choking up a bit as I write about 
him. I used to laugh about writers who said they missed their 
characters, but Rudy definitely comes close.

Steiner’s horror at finding charcoal even in his son’s ears. 


max 

Max is the sort of character who shows what persistence and patience 
can do for a book. In the first draft, he was an old man from Vienna. 
Then I wrote him out of the novel completely because I just couldn’t 
get him right. 

By the time I started again for the very last time, though, I’d found 
the link between Max’s father and Hans Hubermann. I also had the 
right age and purpose for him. He was to be twenty-four, or 
thereabouts. He would partly be a replacement for Liesel’s brother. 
And he would bring Mein Kampf and paint over the pages. He and 
Liesel would write stories of friendship over Hitler’s words of hate. 

On another note, sometimes even just one moment is enough to 
warrant the inclusion of a particular character. For Max, I was 
desperate for him to imagine having a boxing match with Hitler in 
the basement of 33 Himmel Street. I wanted to write that line about 
him taking aim, to give it to Hitler in the place it might hurt most. 

f 
(PAST VERSiem OF MAx- ås AN OLDER 

MANN 

A few things I notice here. Apart from being older and from 
Vienna, Max’s last name is Zimmermann, not Vandenburg. 
And the Steiners were the Steinhoffers. 


the illustrations 

As soon as I thought Max would write stories for Liesel and help her 
read, I knew Id be using illustrations and sketches. I liked the idea of 
having books within the book, because it paralleled the theme of 
personal history within world history. For the chapter titled 
“Sketches” in Part Five, I made countless clumsy drawings in my 
notebooks, three of which made it into the manuscript. (I then cut it 
down to two for the finished book.) 

Of course, in the final version, Trudy White performed her own 
brand of magic. 

For The Standover Man and The Word Shaker, I wrote the words but 
left the rest of the pages blank, certain that I had the perfect 
illustrator. I had known Trudy since my first novel came out, and 
we'd been good friends ever since. 

One of my earliest ideas for The Standover Man was for the text of 
Mein Kampf to bleed through to show the story of Max and Liesel’s 
friendship strangling the words of Hitler. But I didn’t tell Trudy that. I 
can’t remember exactly what happened, but I most likely just forgot— 
and she let them bleed through anyway. That was when I knew for 
sure that I had the right person for the job. This was proven yet again 
when she asked if Pd mind her drawing Max as a bird. After all, he 
was always described as having feathers of hair (when it was washed) 
or a nest of twigs (when it was dirty). She was right: I had described 
Max as a caged bird from the moment he arrived on Himmel Street, 
and while I thought drawing him that way might be risky, I saw the 
illustrations and marveled at Trudy’s genius. It gave him that extra 
depth and poetic sensibility that felt perfect. It made a huge 
difference, and I’ll be grateful to her always. 

Walter Kugler, knowing very well that he could never send 
them. The desecrated pages of Mein Kampf were becoming a 
series of sketches, page after page, which to him, summed up 
the events that had swapped his former life for another. Some 
took minutes. Others hours. He resolved that when the book 
was finished, he’d give it to Liesel, when she was old 
enough, and hopefully, when all this nonsense was over. 
From the moment he tested the pencils on the first painted 
page. he kept the book with him at all times. Often, it was 
next to him or still in his fingers as he slept. 
One afternoon, after hie push-ups and sit-ups, he fell 
asleep against the basement wall. When Liesel came down she 
found the book sitting next to him, slanted against his 
thigh, and curiosity got the better of her. She leaned over 
and picked it up, waiting for him to stir. He didn’t. Max was 
sitting with his head and shoulder blades against the wail. 
Open-mouthed, she could barely make out the sound of his 
breath, coasting in and out of him, as she opened the book 
and glimpsed a few random pages.

The main reason I deleted the firing-gun image was 
that it just wasn't as succinct as the other two. And 
two sketches were probably enough for that chapter. 

I also used the idea of the swastikas later on, in 
The Word Shaker. 


finishing 

I am writing this ten years after The Book Thief was published, and as 
I said in the introduction, finishing a book can never be taken for 
granted. 

I won’t say that I said goodbye to the characters. I did my best and 
I was relieved and exhausted and had nothing left to give. Some of 
those characters had fought their way back into the book. Some had 
been there all along. Some bullied their way through, swearing and 
cursing, but generous to the end. Of course, many of them broke my 
heart, despite my knowing I held their fate in my hands, which made 
it even harder. 

Before publication, there’s always a moment when you suddenly 
understand that if you keep working on the book, you’re going to 
start hurting it. You might be making things more correct, but never 
more right. 

I couldn’t write The Book Thief again now, and I’m honestly not 
sure ld want to. I do look back with a few regrets, but I also know it 
was the best I could do. It gave me my happiest moment of writing a 
book’s final words, when somehow you just know— 

At that exact moment, you feel like you’re the only person awake in 
the world. Or, at least, the only one who just finished writing a book. 
Lastly, to all the readers out there who’ve given this book its own 
life of sorts, what can I say but thank you. Thanks for handing it to 
your families and friends, and for giving it as much love as I did. 
You’ve made all the difference. 

Best always,

IN HIS OWN WORDS 

A CONVERSATION WITH MARKUS ZUSAK 

Q: What inspired you to write about a hungry, illiterate girl who 
has such a desire to read that she steals books? 

A: I think it’s just working on a book over and over again. I heard 
stories of cities on fire, teenagers who were whipped for giving 
starving Jewish people bread on their way to concentration camps, 
and people huddled in bomb shelters .... But I also had a story 
about a book thief set in my hometown of Sydney I just brought the 
two ideas together and realized the importance of words in Nazi 
Germany. I thought of Hitler destroying people with words, and 
now I had a girl who was stealing them back, as she read books 
with the young Jewish man in her basement and calmed people 
down in the bomb shelters. She writes her own story—and it’s a 
beautiful story—through the ugliness of the world that surrounds 
her. 

Q: There are many novels set during the Holocaust, but The Book 
Thief offers a different perspective. What do you most want 
teenage readers to understand about Liesel’s story and this 
dark period in our world’s history? 

A: I honestly just hope that they’ll never forget the characters. This is 
the first time I’ve ever missed characters that I’ve written— 
especially Liesel and Rudy. I also hope that readers of any age will 
see another side of Nazi Germany, where certain people did hide 
their Jewish friends to save their lives (at the risk of their own). I 
wanted them to see people who were unwilling to fly the Nazi flag, 
and boys and girls who thought the Hitler Youth was boring and 
ridiculous. If nothing else, there’s another side that lives beneath 
the propaganda reels that are still so effective decades later. Those 
were the pockets I was interested in. 

Q: Liesel has an uncanny understanding of people and an ability 
to befriend those who most need companionship. Who do you 
think is Liesel’s most unforgettable friend? 

A: For me it’s Rudy, but a lot of people will tell me it’s Hans 
Hubermann, Max, the mayor’s wife, or even Rosa Hubermann. 
Rudy is just my favorite character. From the moment he painted 
himself black and became Jesse Owens, he was my favorite. Liesel 
kissing his dusty, bomb-hit lips was probably the most devastating 
part of the book for me to write.... I was a mess. 

On the other hand, I’m also drawn to all of the relationships 
Liesel forms, even her reading with Frau Holtzapfel, and the return 
of her son. Even Ludwig Schmeikl—the boy she beats up on the 
playground and reconciles with at the book-burning ... I think the 
relationship with Rosa is the most unexpected, though. The 
moment when she sees Rosa with the accordion strapped to her 
(when Hans is sent to the war) is when she realizes exactly how 
much love her foster mother is capable of. 

Q: Your use of figurative language seems natural and effortless. 
Is this something that you have to work to develop, or is it 
innately a part of your writing style? 

A: I like the idea that every page in every book can have a gem on it. 
It’s probably what I love most about writing—that words can be 
used in a way that’s like a child playing in a sandpit, rearranging 
things, swapping them around. They’re the best moments in a day 
of writing—when an image appears that you didn’t know would be 
there when you started work in the morning. 

At other stages, it takes time. It took three years to write this 
book, and some images remained from start to finish, but others 
were considered and reconsidered dozens of times, if not more. 
Often, to keep the workday flowing, Pll continue writing the story 
and then come back later to develop an image that hasn’t worked 
from the outset. I might even take it out completely. 

Q: There are numerous details about the setting of the book. Did 
you have to do extensive research? How long did it take you to 
prepare for writing this novel? 

A: Research isn’t my strong point—I have to be absolutely honest 
about that. The whole time I was researching, I was thinking, 
“Come on, hurry up, will you? Get home and start writing....” To a 
certain extent, the world of Molching was given to me. It was in my 
mind, dormant from childhood, on account of all the stories I was 
told by my parents. In terms of getting the details right, that was 
both a hindrance and a huge advantage. History gave this story its 
bombings, towns, and people. Getting them in the right time and 
place in the book was more difficult than people might imagine— 
but it also gave me a framework to place my story on. 

I really did the research in phases, before, during, and after I’d 
finished the manuscript. It wasn’t until the end of the writing that I 
went to Munich to check all of my facts, especially little things, like 
the seasonal habits of apple trees! (Liesel and Rudy’s apple-stealing 
needed to occur in the right month.) I guess the little things mean a 
lot. When they add up, hopefully they make the book complete.
